Yet You are the origin of the entire cosmic manifestation. You are Brahman, the greatest of everything, full of effulgence like the sun. You have no material cause, You are free from change and deviation, and You have no material desires. Thus the Vedas say that You are the substance. Therefore, my Lord, You are directly the origin of all Vedic statements, and by understanding You, one gradually understands everything.

INTO THEM, FIVE LIBATIONS ARE POURED BY DEMIGODS ACTING AS SACRIFICIAL PRIESTS. THE FIVE LIBATIONS ARE: SRADDHA, SOMA, RAIN, FOOD AND SEED. SO ILLUSTRATES THE CHANDOGYA UPANISAD THE PATH OF THE SOUL'S DEPARTURE FROM EARTH TO HEAVEN AND BACK TO EARTH AGAIN. IN ORDER FOR THE SOUL TO TRAVERSE THIS PATH, IT MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE ELEMENTS OF THE SUBTLE MATERIAL BODY.","After the incarnation of the first purusa [Karanarnavasayi Visnu], the mahat-tattva, or the principles of material creation, take place, and then time is manifested, and in course of time the three qualities appear. Nature means the three qualitative appearances. They transform into activities. mahatas tu vikurvanad rajah-sattvopa brmhitat tamah-pradhanas tv abhavad dravya jnana-kriyatma kah mahatah--of the mahat-tattva; tu--but; vikurvanat--being transformed; rajah--the material mode of passion; sattva--the mode of goodness; upabrmhitat--because of being increased; tamah--the mode of darkness; pradhanah--being prominent; tu--but; abhavat--took place; dravya-- matter; jnana--material knowledge; kriya-atmakah--predominantly material activities. TRANSLATION Material activities are caused by the mahat-tattva's being agitated. At first there is transformation of the modes of goodness and passion, and later--due to the mode of ignorance--matter, its knowledge, and different activities of material knowledge come into play. so 'hankara iti prokto vikurvan samabhut tridha vaikarikas taijasas ca tamasas ceti yad-bhida dravya-saktih kriya-saktir 1118118 -5 81९1-1 iti prabho sah--the very same thing; ahankarah--ego; iti--thus; proktah--said; vikurvan--being transformed; samabhut--became manifested; tridha--in three features; vaikarikah--in the mode of goodness; taijasah--in the mode of passion; ca--and; tamasah--in the mode of ignorance: ca--also; iti--thus; yat--what is; bhida--divided; dravya-saktih--powers that evolve matter; kriya-saktih--initiation that creates; jnana-saktih-- intelligence that guides; iti--thus; prabho--O master. TRANSLATION The self-centered materialistic ego, thus being transformed into thr features, becomes known as the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance in three divisions, namely the powers that evolve matter, knowledge of material creations, and the intelligence that guides such materialistic activities. Narada, you are quite competent to understand this. tamasad api bhutader vikurvanad abhun nabhah tasya matra gunah sabdo lingam yad drastr-drsyayoh tamasat--from the darkness of false ego; api--certainly; bhuta-adeh--of the material elements; vikurvanat--because of transformation; abhut-- generated; nabhah--the sky; tasya--its; matra--subtle form; gunah-- quality; sabdah--sound; lingam--characteristics; yat--as its; drastr-- the seer; drsyayoh--of what is seen. TRANSLATION From the darkness of false ego, the first of the five elements, namely the sky, is generated. Its subtle form is the quality of sound, exactly as the seer is in relationship with the seen. nabhaso 'tha vikurvanad abhut sparsa-guno 'nilah paranvayac chabdavams ca prana ojah saho balam vayor api vikurvanat kala-karma-sva bhavatah udapadyata tejo vai rupavat sparsa-sa bdavat tejasas tu vikurvanad asid ambho rasatmakam rupavat sparsavac cambho ghosavac ca paranvayat visesas tu vikurvanad ambhaso gandhavan abhut paranvayad 1८888 - 51o8८58 - sabda-rupa-gunanvitah nabhasah--of the sky; atha--thus; vikurvanat--being transformed; a bhut--generated; sparsa--touch; gunah--quality; anilah--air; para-- previous; anvayat--by succession; sabdavan--full of sound; ca--also; pranah--life; ojah--sense perception; sahah--fat; balam--strength; vayoh--of the air; api--also; vikurvanat--by transformation; kala-- time; karma--reaction of the past; svabhavatah--on the basis of nature; udapadyata--generated; tejah--fire; vai--duly; rupavat--with form; Ssparsa--touch; sabdavat--with sound also; tejasah--of the fire; tu-- but; vikurvanat--on being transformed; asit--it so happened; ambhah-- water; rasa-atmakam--composed of juice; rupavat--with form; sparsavat-- with touch; ca--and; ambhah--water; ghosavat--with sound; ca--and; para--previous; anvayat--by succession; visesah--variegatedness; tu-- but; vikurvanat--by transformation; ambhasah--of water; gandhavan-- odorous; abhut--became; para--previous; anvayat--by succession; rasa-- juice; sparsa--touch; sabda--sound; rupa-gu na-anvitah--qualitative. TRANSLATION Because the sky is transformed, the air is generated with the quality of touch, and by previous succession the air is also full of sound and the basic principles of duration of life: sense perception, mental power and bodily strength. When the air is transformed in course of time and nature's course, fire is generated, taking shape with the sense of touch and sound. Since fire is also transformed, there is a manifestation of water, full of juice and taste. As previously, it also has form and touch and is also full of sound. And water, being transformed from all variegatedness on earth, appears odorous and, as previously, becomes qualitatively full of juice, touch, sound and form respectively. vaikarikan mano jajne deva vaikarika dasa dig-vatarka-praceto 'svi- vahnindropendra-mitra-kah vaikarikat--from the mode of goodness; manah--the mind; jajne-- generated; devah--demigods; vaikarikah--in the mode of goodness; dasa-- ten; dik--the controller of directions; vata--the controller of air; arka--the sun; pracetah--Varuna; asvi--the Asvini-kumaras; vahni--the fire-god; indra--the King of heaven; upendra--the deity in heaven; mitra--one of the twelve Adityas; kah--Prajapati Brahma. TRANSLATION From the mode of goodness the mind is generated and becomes manifest, as also the ten demigods controlling the bodily movements. Such demigods are known as the controller of directions, the controller of air, the sun-god, the father of Daksa Prajapati, the Asvini-kumaras, the fire-god, the King of heaven, the worshipable deity in heaven, the chief of the Adityas, and Brahmaji, the Prajapati. All come into existence. taijasat tu vikurvanad indriyani dasa bhavan jJnana-saktih kriya-saktir buddhih pranas ca taijasau srotram tvag-ghrana-drg jihva vag-dor-medhranghri-payavah taijasat--by the passionate egoism; tu--but; vikurvanat--transformation of; indriyani--the senses; dasa--ten; abhavan--generated; jnana-saktih- -the five senses for acquiring knowledge; kriya-saktih--the five senses of activities; buddhih--intelligence; pranah--the living energy; ca-- also; taijasau--all products of the mode of passion; srotram--the sense for hearing; tvak--the sense for touching; ghrana--the sense for smelling; drk--the sense for seeing; jihvah--the sense for tasting; vak--the sense for speaking; doh--the sense for handling; medhra--the genitals; anghri--the legs; payavah--the sense for evacuating. TRANSLATION By further transformation of the mode of passion, the sense organs like the ear, skin, nose, eyes, tongue, mouth, hands, genitals, legs, and the outlet for evacuating, together with intelligence and living energy, are all generated. yadaite 'sangata bhava bhutendriya-mano-gunah yadayatana-nirmane na sekur brahma-vittama yada--as long as; ete--all these; asangatah--without being assembled; bhavah--remained so situated; bhuta--elements; indriya--senses; manah-- mind; gunah--modes of nature; yada--so long; ayatana--the body; nirmane--in being formed; na sekuh--was not possible; brahma-vit-tama- -O Narada, the best knower of transcendental knowledge. TRANSLATION O Narada, best of the transcendentalists, the forms of the body cannot take place as long as these created parts, namely the elements, senses, mind and modes of nature, are not assembled. tada samhatya canyonyam bhagavac-chakti-coditah sad-asattvam upadaya cobhayam sasrjur hy adah tada--all those; samhatya--being assembled; ca--also; anyonyam--one another; bhagavat--by the Personality of Godhead; sakti--energy; coditah--being applied; sat-asattvam--primarily and secondarily; upadaya--accepting; ca--also; ubhayam--both; sasrjuh--came into existence; hi--certainly; adah--this universe. TRANSLATION Thus when all these became assembled by force of the energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this universe certainly came into being by accepting both the primary and secondary causes of creation. 3: Th | । । । tt ॥ ॥ ॥ | ॥ ।॥ । dt to ttt vehicles ।| । । । । । ॥ ॥ । । । । ॥ ॥ -- o -- rrr rot ॥ । ॥ ॥ rot soul ar rrr rot ॥ । ॥ ॥ rot -- o -- ॥ ॥ ॥ ॥ made 7 । । ¦ ¦ ¦ । VARIOUS SASTRIC TEXTS INDICATE THAT THE BODIES OF LIVING BEINGS ARE MADE FROM EARTH, WATER OR FIRE.

TRANSLATION The subtle body is endowed with sixteen parts--the five knowledge- acquiring senses, the five working senses, the five objects of sense gratification, and the mind. This subtle body is an effect of the three modes of material nature. It is composed of insurmountably strong desires, and therefore it causes the living entity to transmigrate from one body to another in human life, animal life and life as a demigod. When the living entity gets the body of a demigod, he is certainly very jubilant, when he gets a human body he is always in lamentation, and when he gets the body of an animal, he is always afraid.

She also has a holy name and form, whereas You are the support of all such names and forms and the cause for their manifestation. GODDESS LAKSMI IS THE FORM OF PURE DEVOTION TO THE SUPREME LORD."

TRANSLATION Lord Krsna saw the unbroken disk of the full moon glowing with the red effulgence of newly applied vermilion, as if it were the face of the goddess of fortune. He also saw the kumuda lotuses opening in response to the moon's presence and the forest gently illumined by its rays. Thus the Lord began to play sweetly on His flute, attracting the minds of the beautiful-eyed gopis. 1o.33.2 tatrarabhata govindo rasa-kridam anuvrataih stri-ratnair anvitah pritair anyonyabaddha-bahubhih tatra--there; arabhata--began; govinda--Lord Krsna; rasa-kridam--the pastimes of the rasa dance; anuvrataih--by the faithful (gopis); stri-- of women; ratnaih--the jewels; anvitah--joined; pritaih--who were satisfied; anyonya--among one another; abaddha--entwining; bahubhih-- their arms.

TRANSLATION As the gopis sang in praise of Krsna, their feet danced, their hands gestured, and their eyebrows moved with playful smiles. With their braids and belts tied tight, their waists bending, their faces perspiring, the garments on their breasts moving this way and that, and their earrings swinging on their cheeks, Lord Krsna's young consorts shone like streaks of lightning in a mass of clouds. 1o.33.16 evam parisvanga-karabhimarsa snigdheksanoddama-vilasa-hasaih reme rameso vraja-sundaribhir yatharbhakah sva-pratibimba-vibhramah evam--thus; parisvanga--with embracing; kara--by His hand; abhimarsa-- with touching; snigdha--affectionate; iksana--with glances; uddama-- broad; vilasa--playful; hasaih--with smiles; reme--He took pleasure; rama--of the goddess of fortune; isah--the master; vraja-sundaribhih-- with the young women of the cowherd community; yatha--just as; arbhakah--a boy; sva--His own; pratibimba--with the reflection; vibhramah--whose playing. TRANSLATION In this way Lord Krsna, the original Lord Narayana, master of the goddess of fortune, took pleasure in the company of the young women of Vraja by embracing them, caressing them and glancing lovingly at them as He smiled His broad, playful smiles. It was just as if a child were playing with his own reflection. in all LORD SRI KRSNA IS THE ORIGINAL PERSONALITY OF GODHEAD. HE ENJOYS WONDERFUL PASTIMES IN HIS OWN EXPANDED FORMS LIKE LORD BALARAMA, THE CATUR-VYUHA AND THE DASA-AVATARAS.

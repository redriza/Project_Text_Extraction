1. Supreme felicity is attained by the knowledge about the true nature of sixteen categories, viz., means of right knowledge (*pramāṇa*), object of right knowledge (*pramaeya*), doubt (*saṃśaya*), purpose (*prayojana*), familiar instance (*dṛṣṭānta*), established tenet (*siddhanta*), members (*avayava*), confutation (*tarka*), ascertainment (*nirṇaya*), discussion (*vāda*), wrangling (*jalpa*), cavil (*vitandā*), fallacy (*hetvābhāsa*), quibble (*chala*), futility (*jāti*), and occasion for rebuke (*nigrahasthāna*).

Knowledge about the true nature of sixteen categories means true knowledge of the “enunciation,” “definition,” and “critical examination” of the categories. Book I (of the Nyāya-Sūtra) treats of “enunciation” and “definition,” while the remaining four Books are reserved for “critical examination.” The attainment of supreme felicity is preceded by the knowledge of four things, viz., (1) that which is fit to be abandoned (viz.,

2. Pain, birth, activity, faults, and misapprehension—on the successive annihilation of these in reverse order, there follows release.

3. *Pratyakṣa*, *anumāna*, *upamāna*, *śabda*—these are the *pramāṇas*.


The Cārvākas admit only one *pramāṇa*, viz., *pratyakṣa*; the Vaiśeṣikas and Bauddhas admit two, viz., *pratyakṣa* and *anumāna*; the Sāṅkhyas admit three, viz., *pratyakṣa*, *anumāna*, and *śabda*; while the Naiyāyikas, whose fundamental work is the *Nyāya-sūtra*, admit four, viz., *pratyakṣa*, *anumāna*, *śabda*, and *upamāna*. The Prabhākaras admit a fifth *pramāṇa* called *arthāpatti*; the Bhāṭṭas and Vedāntins admit a sixth, viz., *abhāva*; and the Pūrvapakṣins recognize a seventh and eighth *pramāṇa*, named *sambhāva* and *āitihya*.

4. Perception is that knowledge which arises from the contact of a sense with its object and which is determinate, unnameable, and non-erratic.

Determinate.—This epithet distinguishes perception from indeterminate knowledge; for instance, a man looking from a distance cannot ascertain whether there is smoke or dust.

Unnameable.—Signifies that the knowledge of a thing derived through perception has no connection with the name which the thing bears.

Non-erratic.—In summer, the sun’s rays coming in contact with earthly heat quiver and appear to the eyes of men as water. The knowledge of water derived in this way is not perception. To eliminate such cases, the epithet non-erratic has been used.

[This aphorism may also be translated as follows: Perception is knowledge which arises from the contact of a sense with its object and which is non-erratic, being either indeterminate (*nirvikalpaka*, as “this is something”) or determinate (*savikalpaka*, as “this is a Brāhmaṇa”).]

5. Inference is knowledge which is preceded by perception, and is of three kinds, viz., *ā priori*, *ā posteriori*, and ‘commonly seen.’

*Ā priori* is the knowledge of effect derived from the perception of its cause, e.g., one seeing clouds infers that there will be rain.

*Ā posteriori* is the knowledge of cause derived from the perception of its effect, e.g., one seeing a river swollen infers that there was rain.

‘Commonly seen’ is the knowledge of one thing derived from the perception of another thing with which it is commonly seen, e.g., one seeing a beast possessing horns infers that it possesses also a tail, or one seeing smoke on a hill infers that there is fire on it.

Vātsyāyana takes the last to be “not commonly seen,” which he interprets as the knowledge of a thing which is not commonly seen, e.g., observing affection, aversion, and other qualities one infers that there is a substance called soul.

6. Comparison is the knowledge of a thing through its similarity to another thing previously well known.

4. 200 I, CHAPTER I.

A man, hearing from a forester that a *bos gavaeus* is like a cow, resorts to a forest where he sees an animal like a cow. Having recollected what he heard, he institutes a comparison, by which he arrives at the conviction that the animal which he sees is *bos gavaeus*. This is knowledge derived through comparison. Some hold that comparison is not a separate means of knowledge, for when one notices the likeness of a cow in a strange animal, one really performs an act of perception. In reply, it is urged that we cannot deny comparison as a separate means of knowledge, for how else does the name *bos gavaeus* signify the general notion of the animal called *bos gavaeus*? That the name *bos gavaeus* signifies one and all members of the *bos gavaeus* class is not a result of perception but the consequence of a distinct knowledge called comparison.

7. *Śabda* (*verbal testimony*) is the instructive assertion of a reliable person.

A reliable person is one—be he a *yavan*, *Ārya*, or *mleccha*—who, as an expert in a certain matter, is willing to communicate his experience of it.

8. It is of two kinds, viz., that which refers to matter which is seen and that which refers to matter which is not seen.

The first kind involves matter which can be actually verified.

Though we are incapable of verifying the matter involved in the second kind, we can somehow ascertain it by means of inference.

9. Soul, body, senses, objects of sense, intellect, mind, activity, fault, transmigration, fruit, pain, and release—are the objects of right knowledge. The objects of right knowledge are also enumerated as substance, quality, action, generality, particularity, intimate relation, and non-existence, which are the technicalities of the Vaiśeṣika philosophy.

10. Desire, aversion, volition, pleasure, pain, and intelligence are the marks of the soul.  [These abide in the soul, or rather are the qualities of the substance called soul.]

11. Body is the site of gesture, senses, and sentiments. Body is the site of gesture inasmuch as it strives to reach what is desirable and to avoid what is hateful. It is also the site of senses, for the latter act well or ill according as the former is in good or bad order. Sentiments, which comprise pleasure and pain, are also located in the body which experiences them.

12. Nose, tongue, eye, skin, and ear are the senses produced from elements. Nose is of the same nature as earth, tongue as water, eye as light, skin as air, and ear as ether.

13. Earth, water, light, air, and ether—these are the elements.

14. Smell, taste, colour, touch, and sound are objects of the senses and qualities of the earth, etc. Smell is the object of nose and the prominent quality of earth; taste is the object of tongue and quality of water; colour is the object of eye and quality of light; touch is the object of skin and quality of air; and sound is the object of ear and quality of ether.

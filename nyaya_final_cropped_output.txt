1. Supreme felicity is attained by the knowledge
out the truc nature of sixteen categories, viz., means of
tht knowledge (pramfna), object of right knowledge (pra-
eya), doubt (sarhgaya), purpose (prayojana), familiar instance
rstdnta), established tenet (siddhanta), members (avayava),
nfutation (tarka*),- asccrtainment (nirmaya), discussion
ida), wrangling (jalpa), cavil (vitanda), fallacy (hetvabhisa),
ibble (chala), futility (व), and occasion for rebuke
grahasthaéna).

Knowledge about the truce nature of sixteen ‘categories t means true
wledge of the “ enunciation,” “ definition ” and “ critical examination ”
he categories. Book L (of the Nydya-Satra) treats of “ enunciation ”
definition,” while the remaining Jour Books are reserved for “ critical

mination.” The attainment of supreme felicity is preceded by the
wledge of four things, viz., (1) that which is fit to be abandoned (wiz.,

*The English equivalent for “tarkw" is variously given as “confutation,” “ argu-
ation ,” “ reductio ad absurdum,"” “hypothctical reasoning,” etc.

2. Pain, birth, activity, faults and misapprehension—

1 the successive annihiJation of these in the reverse order,
ere follows release

| Misappreheusion, faults, activity, birth and pain, these in their
interrupted course constitute the “world.” Release, which consists in
> soul’s getting rid af the world, is the condition of supreme felicity
irked by perfect. tranquillity and not tainted by any defilement. A
rson, by the true knowledge of the sixteen categories, is able to
nove his misapprehensions. Whien this is done, his faults, viz., affection,
rsion ant stupidity, disappear. He is then no longer subject to any
Ivity and 1४ consequently freed from transmigration and pains. This
116 way in which his release is effected and supreme felicity secured.

3. Perception, inference, comparison and word (ver-
] testinony)—these are the means of right knowledge.

[The Cirvikas admit only one means of right knowledge, viz.,

ception (pratyaksai, the Vaisesikas and Bauddhas admit two, viz.,
ception and inference (anumiana), the Sinkhyas admit three, viz., per-
tion, inference and verbal testimony (Agama or sabda) while the
dyikas whose fundamental work is the Nyaya-stitra admit four, viz.,
ception, infercnce, verbal testimony and comparison (upaména). The
bhikeras adinit a fifth means of right knowledge called prestunption
hipatti), the Bhattas and Vedintins admit a sixth, viz., non-existence
iva) and the Paurinikas recognise a seventh and eighth means of right
wledge, named probability (sambhava) and rumour (aitihya)].

8 contact of a sense with its object and which is deter-
nate, unnameable and non-erratic.

Determinate.—This epithet distinguishes perception from indetermi-
© knowledge; as for instance, a man‘looking from a distanee cannot
ertain whether there is smoke or «lust.

Onnamenble.—Signifies that the knowledge of a thing derived
ough perception has” no connection with the ame which the thing
1s.

Non-erratic. —In summer the aun’s rays coming in contact with
thly heat quiver and appear to the eyes ef men as water. The know--
ge of water derived in this way is not perception. To climinate such
a8 the epithet non-erratic has been used.

(This aphorism may also be translated as follows :—Pereeption
nowledge and which arises from the contact of asense with its abject and
ch 18 non-erratic being cither indeterminate (nirvikalpaka as “ this is
ething ’) or determinate (savikalpaka as “this is a Brahmana’’)).

5. Inference is knowledge which is preceded by per-
21101, and is of three kinds, viz., & priori, 8 posterior! and
21111101] $ seen. ’

A priori is the knowledge of effect derived from the perception of
“ause, ९. g., one sceing clouds infers that there will be rain.

A posterior? is the Knowledge of cause derived from the perception
its effect, €. g., one seeing a river swollen infors that there was rain.

{‘ Commonly seer’ is the knowledge of one thing derived from the
ception of another thing with which it is commonly seen, e.g., one
ng a beast possessing horns, infers that it possesses also > tail, or
seeing smoke on a hill infers that there is fire on it].

Vitsylyana takes the last to be “not commonly seen” which he
rprots 28 the knowledge of a thing which is not commonly seen, e. g.,
ving affection, aversion and other qualities one infers that there is a
stance called soul.

rts to a forest where he sece an animal like a cow. Having recollected
it he heard he institutes a comparison, by which he arrives at the con-
jon that the animal which he sees is bos gavaeus. ‘This is knowledge
ive through comparison. Some hold that comparison is not a
arate means of knowledge, for when one notices the likeness of a
` in a strange animal one really performs an act of perception. In
ly itis urged that we cannot deny comparison as a separate means of
ywledge, for how docs otherwise the name bos gavaeus signify the
eral notion of the animal called os gavaeus. That the name bos
aeus signifies one and all members of the hos garaeus class is nota
ult of perception but the consequence of a distinet knowledge called
parison.

7. Word (verbal testimony) is the instructive asser-

n of a reliable person.

A reliable person is one—may he a yisi, arya or mleceha, who as an
ert in a certain matter is willing to communicate his experiences of it.

[Suppose a young man coming to the side of a river cannot ascertain
ther the river is fordable or not, and immediately an old experienced
1 of the locality, who has no enmity against him, comes and tells him
t the river is easily fordable: the word of the old man is to he accepted
, means of right knowledge called verbal testimony].

8. It 18 of two kinds, viz., that which refers to matter
ich is seen and that which refers to matter which is not
2४.

The first kind involves matter which can be actually verified.
ugh we are incapable of verifiying the matter involved in the second
1, we can somehow ascertain it by means of inference. \

{Matter which is seen, eg., a physician’s assertion that physical
ngth is gained by taking butter].

[Matter which is not seen, e.g., a religious teacher's assertion that one
quers heaven by performing horse-sacrifices].

4, Perception is that knowledge which arises from: the contact of a sense with its object and which is determinate, unnameable and -non-erratic. Determinate.—This epithet distinguishes perception from indeterminate knowledge; as for instance, "pai man ‘looking from a distance cannot ascertain whether there is smoke or dust. Onnamenble.—Signifies that the knowledge of a thing derived through perception has” no connection with the name which the thing bears. Non-erratic. —In summer the aun’s rays coming in contact with earthly heat quiver and appear to the eyes ef men as water. The know-’ ledge of water derived in this way is not perception. To climinate such cases the epithet nou-erratic has been used. [This aphorism may also be translated as follows :—Pereeption is knowledge and which arises from the contact of asense with its abject and which is non-erratic being cither indeterminate (nirvikalpaka as “ this 19 something ”) or determinate (savikalpaka as “this is a Brahmana’’)). aa agers “nrividhamanumāne pūva̭vacleṣavatsāmānyato daṣṭa ca
5. Inference is knowledge which is preceded by perception, and is of three kinds, viz., & priori, & posteriori and ‘commonly seen. ’ A priori is the knowledge of effect derived from the perception of its cause, 9. g., one seeing clouds infers that there will be rain. A posterior? is the Knowledge of canse derived from the perception of its effect, €. g., one seeing a river swollen infors that there was rain. {‘ Commonly seer’ is the knowledge of one thing derived from the perception of another thing with whieh it is commonly seen, e. g., one seeing a beast possessing horns, infers that it possesses also a tail, or one seeing smoke on a hill infers that there is fire on it]. VitsyAyana takes the last to be “not commonly seen” which he interprots as the knowledge of a thing which is not commonly seen, 9. g., observing affection, aversion and other qualities one infers that there is a substance called soul.

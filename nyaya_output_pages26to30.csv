Supreme felicity is attained by the knowledge of the true nature of sixteen categories, viz., means of knowledge, object of right knowledge, doubt, purpose, familiar instance, established tenet, members, and occasion for rebuke.","Knowledge about the true nature of sixteen categories is necessary for attaining supreme felicity. The Nydya-Satra treats of enunciation and definition in Book L, while the remaining Journals are reserved for critical examination. The attainment of supreme felicity is preceded by the knowledge of four things: (1) that which is fit to be abandoned, (2) complete destruction of what is fit to be abandoned, (3) the means of destroying what is fit to be abandoned, and (4) the means of destroying what is fit to be abandoned."

There are three kinds of inference: a priori, posterior, and common. A priori is the knowledge of effect derived from the perception of cause. Posterior is the knowledge of cause derived from the perception of effect. Common is the knowledge of one thing derived from the perception of another with which it is commonly seen. Vitsylyana takes the last to be 'not commonly seen' which he reports as the knowledge of a thing which is not commonly seen, e.g., affection, aversion, and other qualities one infers that there is a stance called soul."

1,1,Book 1 — Chapter 1,१.१.७,१.१.७,1.1.7,"7. Word (verbal testimony) is the instructive assertion of a reliable person. A reliable person is one—may he be yisi, arya or mleceha, who as an ert in a certain matter is willing to communicate his experiences of it. [Suppose a young man coming to the side of a river cannot ascertain whether the river is fordable or not, and immediately an old experienced person, who has no enmity against him, comes and tells him that the river is easily fordable: the word of the old man is to be accepted, means of right knowledge called verbal testimony]. ‘स फरत’ दष्टाऽदृष्टार्थत्वात् ॥ 1.1.7 ॥ 8. It is of two kinds, viz., that which refers to matter which is seen and that which refers to matter which is not. The first kind involves matter which can be actually verified. ugh we are incapable of verifying the matter involved in the second, we can somehow ascertain it by means of inference. [Matter which is seen, e.g., a physician’s assertion that physical health is gained by taking butter]. [Matter which is not seen, e.g., a religious teacher’s assertion that one quers heaven by performing horse-sacrifices]. च्रात्मशरीरेन्दरियाथंबुद्धिमनःप्दत्तिदोशप्रेत्यभावफलदुःखा- गौस्तु ‘पमेयम्‌?","The sutra discusses the concept of verbal testimony or word as a means of acquiring knowledge. Verbal testimony is considered reliable if it comes from a trustworthy person who has personal experience of the matter in question. The sutra also distinguishes between two types of verbal testimony: that which refers to matter that can be seen and that which refers to matter that cannot be seen. The first type involves matter that can be verified, while the second type involves matter that cannot be verified but can be inferred through means of reasoning. The sutra provides examples of both types of verbal testimony, including a physician's assertion that physical health is gained by taking butter and a religious teacher's assertion that one quers heaven by performing horse-sacrifices."

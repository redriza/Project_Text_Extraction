Book I.—Chapter I.

1. Supreme felicity is attained by the knowledge about the true nature of sixteen categories, viz., means of right knowledge (pramana), object of right knowledge (pra-meya), doubt (samsaya), purpose (prayojana), familiar instance (drstanta), established tenet (siddhanta), members (avayava), confutation (tarka), ascertainment (nijnaya), discussion (vada), wrangling (jalpa), cavil (vitanda), fallacy (hetvabhasa), quibble (chala), futility (jati), and occasion for rebuke (nigrahasthana).

Knowledge about the true nature of these sixteen categories means true knowledge of the “enunciation,” “definition,” and “critical examination” of the categories. Book I (of the Nyaya-Sutra) treats of “enunciation” and “definition,” while the remaining four Books are reserved for “critical examination.” The attainment of supreme felicity is preceded by the knowledge of four things, viz., (1) that which is fit to be abandoned (viz.,

pain), (2) that which produces what is fit to be abandoned (viz., misapprehension, etc.), (3) complete destruction of what is fit to be abandoned, and (4) the means of destroying what is fit to be abandoned (viz., true knowledge).

दुःखजन्मप्रहृत्तिदोषमिथ्याज्ञानानामुत्तरोत्तरापाये तदनन्तरापायावपव्ैः ॥१।१।२॥

2. Pain, birth, activity, faults, and misapprehension—on the successive annihilation of these in the reverse order, there follows release.

Misapprehension, faults, activity, birth, and pain: these, in their uninterrupted course, constitute the “world.” Release, which consists in the soul’s getting rid of the world, is the condition of supreme felicity marked by perfect tranquillity and not tainted by any defilement. A person, by the true knowledge of the sixteen categories, is able to remove his misapprehensions. When this is done, his faults, viz., affection, aversion, and stupidity, disappear. He is then no longer subject to any activity and is consequently freed from transmigration and pain. This is the way in which his release is effected and supreme felicity secured.

प्रयक्तानुमानोपमानशब्दाः “प्रमाणानि” ॥१।१।३॥

3. Perception, inference, comparison, and word (verbal testimony)—these are the means of right knowledge.

[The Cirvikas admit only one means of right knowledge, viz., perception (pratyakṣa); the Vaiseṣikas and Bauddhas admit two, viz., perception and inference (anumāna); the Sāṅkhyas admit three, viz., perception, inference, and verbal testimony (śabda); while the Naiyāyikas, whose fundamental work is the Nyāya-sūtra, admit four, viz., perception, inference, verbal testimony, and comparison (upamāna). The Prabhākaras admit a fifth means of right knowledge called presumption (arthāpatti); the Bhāṭṭas and Vedāntins admit a sixth, viz., non-existence (abhava); and the Pūrvapakṣikas recognize a seventh and eighth means of right knowledge, named probability (sambhava) and rumour (aitihya).]

4. Perception is that knowledge which arises from the contact of a sense with its object and which is determinate, unnameable, and non-erratic.

Determinate.—This epithet distinguishes perception from indeterminate knowledge; for instance, a man looking from a distance cannot ascertain whether there is smoke or dust.

Unnameable.—Signifies that the knowledge of a thing derived through perception has no connection with the name which the thing bears.

Non-erratic.—In summer, the sun’s rays coming in contact with earthly heat quiver and appear to the eyes of men as water. The knowledge of water derived in this way is not perception. To eliminate such cases, the epithet non-erratic has been used.

[This aphorism may also be translated as follows: Perception is knowledge which arises from the contact of a sense with its object and which is non-erratic, being either indeterminate (nirvikalpaka as “this is something”) or determinate (savikalpaka as “this is a Brahmana”).]

5. Inference is knowledge which is preceded by perception, and is of three kinds, viz., a priori, a posteriori, and ‘commonly seen.’

A priori is the knowledge of effect derived from the perception of its cause, e.g., one seeing clouds infers that there will be rain.

A posteriori is the knowledge of cause derived from the perception of its effect, e.g., one seeing a river swollen infers that there was rain.

‘Commonly seen’ is the knowledge of one thing derived from the perception of another thing with which it is commonly seen, e.g., one seeing a beast possessing horns infers that it possesses also a tail, or one seeing smoke on a hill infers that there is fire on it.

VitsyAyana takes the last to be “not commonly seen,” which he interprets as the knowledge of a thing which is not commonly seen, e.g., observing affection, aversion, and other qualities one infers that there is a substance called soul.

6. Comparison is the knowledge of a thing through its similarity to another thing previously well known.


========================= START OF PAGE 29 =========================

4  200 I, CHAPTER I.

A man, hearing from a forester that a bos gavaeus is like a cow, resorts to a forest where he sees an animal like a cow. Having recollected what he heard, he institutes a comparison, by which he arrives at the conviction that the animal which he sees is a bos gavaeus. This is knowledge derived through comparison. Some hold that comparison is not a separate means of knowledge, for when one notices the likeness of a cow in a strange animal, one really performs an act of perception. In reply, it is urged that we cannot deny comparison as a separate means of knowledge, for how else does the name bos gavaeus signify the general notion of the animal called bos gavaeus? That the name bos gavaeus signifies one and all members of the bos gavaeus class is not a result of perception but the consequence of a distinct knowledge called comparison.


7. Word (verbal testimony) is the instructive assertion of a reliable person.

A reliable person is one—be he a yisi, Arya, or mleccha—who, as an expert in a certain matter, is willing to communicate his experiences of it.

[Suppose a young man coming to the side of a river cannot ascertain whether the river is fordable or not, and immediately an old experienced man of the locality, who has no enmity against him, comes and tells him that the river is easily fordable: the word of the old man is to be accepted as a means of right knowledge called verbal testimony].

“स द्विविधो दष्टाऽदृष्टा्थत्वात्‌ ॥ १।१।८ ॥

8. It is of two kinds, viz., that which refers to matter which is seen and that which refers to matter which is not seen.

The first kind involves matter which can be actually verified.

Though we are incapable of verifying the matter involved in the second kind, we can somehow ascertain it by means of inference.


{Matter which is seen, e.g., a physician’s assertion that physical strength is gained by taking butter].
[Matter which is not seen, e.g., a religious teacher's assertion that one conquers heaven by performing horse-sacrifices].

9. Soul, body, senses, objects of sense, intellect, mind, activity, fault, transmigration, fruit, pain, and release are the objects of right knowledge. The objects of right knowledge are also enumerated as substance, quality, action, generality, particularity, intimate relation [and non-existence, which are the technicalities of the Vaiseṣika philosophy].

॥ १।१।१०॥

10. Desire, aversion, volition, pleasure, pain, and intelligence are the marks of the soul. [These abide in the soul or rather are the qualities of the substance called soul].

॥१।१।११॥

11. Body is the site of gesture, senses, and sentiments. Body is the site of gesture inasmuch as it strives to reach what is desirable and to avoid what is hateful. It is also the site of senses, for the latter act well or ill, according as the former is in good or bad order. Sentiments, which comprise pleasure and pain, are also located in the body which experiences them.

॥१।१।१२॥

12. Nose, tongue, eye, skin, and ear are the senses produced from elements. Nose is of the same nature as earth, tongue as water, eye as light, skin as air, and ear as ether.

॥ १।१।१३॥

13. Earth, water, light, air, and ether—these are the elements.

14. Smell, taste, color, touch, and sound are objects of the senses and qualities of the earth, etc. Smell is the object of the nose and the prominent quality of earth; taste is the object of the tongue and quality of water; color is the object of the eye and quality of light; touch is the object of the skin and quality of air; and sound is the object of the ear and quality of ether.


========================= START OF PAGE 31 =========================

6 BOOK I, CHAPTER I.

“बुद्धिः उपलच्िज्ञानमित्यनथोन्तरम्‌ ॥१।१।१५॥

15. Intellect, apprehension, and knowledge—these are not different from one another.


“युगपञ्ज्ञानानुत्पत्तिः “मनसो लिङ्गम.” ॥९।९।९६॥

16. The mark of the mind is that more than one act of knowledge does not arise in the soul at a time.

It is impossible to perceive two things simultaneously. Perception does not arise merely from the contact of a sense-organ with its object, but it also requires a conjunction of the mind. Now, the mind, which is an atomic substance, cannot be conjoined with more than one sense-organ at a time; hence, there cannot occur more acts of perception than one at one time.

“प्रवृत्तिः वाग्बुद्धिशरीरारम्भ इति ॥१।१।१७॥
17. Activity is that which makes the voice, mind, and body begin their action.

There are three kinds of action, namely, vocal, mental, and bodily, each of which may be subdivided as good or bad. Bodily actions which are bad are: (1) killing, (2) stealing, and (3) committing adultery.

Bodily actions which are good are: (1) giving, (2) protecting, and (3) serving.

Vocal actions which are bad are: (1) telling a lie, (2) using harsh language, (3) slandering, and (4) indulging in frivolous talk.

Vocal actions which are good are: (1) speaking the truth, (2) speaking what is useful, (3) speaking what is pleasant, and (4) reading sacred books.

Mental actions which are bad are: (1) malice, (2) covetousness, and (3) skepticism.

Mental actions which are good are: (1) compassion, (2) refraining from covetousness, and (3) devotion.

THE NYAYA-SOTRAS. नै
रवत्तनालक्षणा “दोषाः? ॥१।१।१८॥

18. Faults have the characteristic of causing activity. The faults are affection, aversion, and stupidity.

19. Transmigration means rebirths. Transmigration is the series of births and deaths. Birth is the connection of the soul with body, sense-organs, mind, intellect, and sentiments, while death is the soul’s separation from them.

परदृत्तिदोषजनितोऽर्थः “फलम्‌” ॥१।१।२०॥
20. Fruit is the thing produced by activity and faults. Fruit consists in the enjoyment of pleasure or suffering of pain. All activity and faults end in producing pleasure, which is acceptable, and pain, which is fit only to be avoided.

बाधनालक्षणं “दुःखम्‌ ” इति ॥१।१।२१॥
21. Pain has the characteristic of causing uneasiness. Pain is affliction which everyone desires to avoid. The aphorism may also be translated as follows: Pain is the mark of hindrance to the soul.

तदत्यन्तविमो्तः “BT” ॥१।१।२२॥

22. Release is the absolute deliverance from pain. A soul which is no longer subject to transmigration is freed from all pains. Transmigration, which consists in the soul’s leaving one body and taking another, is the cause of its undergoing pleasure and pain. The soul attains release as soon as there is an end of the body, and, consequently, of pleasure and pain. Those are mistaken who maintain that release enables the soul not only to get rid of all pains but also to attain eternal pleasure, for pleasure is as impermanent as pain and the body.

23. Doubt, which is a conflicting judgment about the precise character of an object, arises from the recognition of properties common to many objects, or of properties not


========================= START OF PAGE 33 =========================

8 - BOOK I, CHAPTER I.

Doubt arises from common properties, conflicting testimony, and irregularity of perception and non-perception.

Doubt is of five kinds according as it arises from—

(1) Recognition of common properties—e.g., seeing in the twilight a tall object, we cannot decide whether it is a man or a post, for the property of tallness belongs to both.

(2) Recognition of properties not common—e.g., hearing a sound, one questions whether it is eternal or not, for the property of sound abides neither in man, beast, etc., that are non-eternal nor in atoms which are eternal.

(3) Conflicting testimony—e.g., merely by study one cannot decide whether the soul exists, for one system of philosophy affirms that it does, while another system states that it does not.

(4) Irregularity of perception—e.g., we perceive water in the tank where it really exists, but water appears also to exist in the mirage where it really does not exist.

A question arises whether water is perceived only when it actually exists or even when it does not exist.

(४८) Irregularity of non-perception—e.g., we do not perceive water in the radish where it really exists, or on dry land where it does not exist.

A question arises whether water is not perceived only when it does not exist, or also when it does exist.


24. Purpose is that with an eye to which one proceeds to act. Purpose refers to the thing which one endeavors to attain or avoid. [A man collects fuel for the purpose of cooking his food].

॥ १।१।२५॥

25. A familiar instance is the thing about which an ordinary man and an expert entertain the same opinion. [With regard to the general proposition ‘wherever there is smoke there is fire,’ the familiar instance is a kitchen in which fire and smoke abide together, to the satisfaction of an ordinary man as well as an acute investigator.]

तन्त्राधिकरणाभ्युपगमसंस्थितिः “सिद्धान्तः? ॥ १।१।२६॥


========================= START OF PAGE 34 =========================

THE NYAYA-SUTRAS.

26. An established tenet is a dogma resting on the authority of a certain school, hypothesis, or implication.

सर्वतन्त्रभ्रतितन्त्राधिकरणाभ्युपगमसंस्थित्यथान्तरभावात्‌ ॥ १। १।२७॥

27. The tenet is of four kinds owing to the distinction between a dogma of all the schools, a dogma peculiar to some school, a hypothetical dogma, and an implied dogma.


28. A tenet accepted by all the schools is a tenet which is not opposed by any school and is claimed by at least one school. The five elements (viz., earth, water, light, air, and ether), the five objects of sense (viz., smell, taste, color, touch, and sound), etc., are tenets which are accepted by all the schools.

समानतन्नसिद्धः wate: पतितन्नाकिद्धान्तः ॥ १।१।२६॥

29. A dogma peculiar to some school is a tenet which is accepted by similar schools but rejected by opposite schools.

“A thing cannot come into existence out of nothing”—this is a peculiar dogma of the Sankhyas. 

यस्सिद्धावन्यभ्रकरणसिद्धिस्स “श्रधिकरणसिद्धान्तः” ॥ १।१।३०॥

30. A hypothetical dogma is a tenet which, if accepted, leads to the acceptance of another tenet.

“There is a soul apart from the senses, because it can recognize the same object by seeing and touching.” If you accept this tenet, you must also have accepted the following: (1) That the senses are more than one, (2) that each of the senses has its particular object, (3) that the soul derives its knowledge through the channels of the senses, (4) that a substance which is distinct from its qualities is the abode of them, etc.


========================= START OF PAGE 35 =========================

10 BOOK 1, CHAPTER I.

31. An implied dogma is a tenet which is not explicitly declared as such, but which follows from the examination of particulars concerning it.

The discussion whether sound is eternal or non-eternal presupposes that it is a substance.  “That sound is a substance” is here an implied dogma. [The mind has nowhere been stated in the Nyaya-sutra to be a sense-organ, but it follows from the particulars examined concerning it that it is so].


32. The members (of a syllogism) are proposition, reason, example, application, and conclusion.

[1. Proposition.—This hill is fiery,

2. Reason.—Because it is smoky,

3. Example.—Whatever is smoky is fiery, as a kitchen,

4. Application.—So is this hill (smoky),

5. Conclusion.—Therefore this hill is fiery].

Some lay down five more members as follows:—

1 (a) Inquiry as to the proposition (jijñāsā).—Is this hill fiery in all its parts, or in a particular part?

2 (a) Questioning the reason (samsaya).—That which you call smoke may be nothing but vapor.

3 (a) Capacity of the example to warrant the conclusion (vākyaprapti).—Is it true that smoke is always a concomitant of fire? In a kitchen there are of course both smoke and fire, but in a red-hot iron-hall there is no smoke.

4 (a) Purpose for drawing the conclusion (prayojana).—Purpose consists in the determination of the true conditions of the hill, in order to ascertain whether it is such that one can approach it, or such that one should avoid it, or such that one should maintain an attitude of indifference towards it.

4 (b) Dispelling all questions (samsayavyudāsa).—It is beyond all questions that the hill is smoky, and that smoke is an invariable concomitant of fire.


========================= START OF PAGE 36 =========================

7 NYAYA-SOTRAS.

33. A proposition is the declaration of what is to be established.  Sound is non-eternal—this is a proposition.

उदाहरणसाधम्यांत्साध्यसाधन “हेतुः ॥ १। १।३४॥

34. The reason is the means for establishing what is to be established through the homogeneous or affirmative character of the example.

Proposition.—Sound is non-eternal.

Reason.—Because it is produced.

Example (homogeneous):—Whatever is produced is non-eternal, as a pot.

The example “pot” possesses the same character as is implied in the reason, viz., “being produced,” inasmuch as both are non-eternal.

35. Likewise through heterogeneous or negative character...

Proposition.—Sound is non-eternal.

Reason.—Because it is produced.

Example (heterogeneous):—Whatever is not non-eternal is not produced, as the soul.

The example “soul” possesses a character heterogeneous to that which is implied in the reason, viz., “being produced,” inasmuch as one is eternal and the other non-eternal.

36. A homogeneous (or affirmative) example is a familiar instance which is known to possess the property to be established and which implies that this property is invariably contained in the reason given.

Proposition—Sound is non-eternal.

Reason—Because it is produced.

Homogeneous example—Whatever is produced is non-eternal, as a pot.

Here “pot” is a familiar instance which possesses the property of non-eternality and implies that whatever is “produced” is attended by the same property (non-eternality).


========================= START OF PAGE 37 =========================

12 BOOK L, CHAPTER 1;

37. A heterogeneous (or negative) example is a familiar instance which is known to be devoid of the property to be established and which implies that the absence of this property is invariably rejected in the reason given.

Proposition—Sound is non-eternal.

Reason—Because it is produced.

Heterogeneous example—Whatever is not non-eternal is not produced, as the soul.

Here the soul is a familiar instance which is known to be devoid of the property of non-eternality and implies that if anything were produced, it would necessarily be deprived of the quality of eternality; i.e., ‘being produced’ and ‘eternal’ are incompatible epithets.


38. Application is a winding up, with reference to the example, of what is to be established as being so or not so.

Application is of two kinds: (1) affirmative and (2) negative. The affirmative application, which is expressed by the word “so,” occurs when the example is of an affirmative character. The negative application, which is expressed by the phrase ‘not so,’ occurs when the example is of a negative character.

Proposition—Sound is non-eternal.

Reason—Because it is produced.

Example—Whatever is produced is non-eternal, as a pot.

Affirmative application.—So is sound (produced).

Conclusion.—Therefore sound is non-eternal.

Or:

Proposition—Sound is not eternal.

Reason—Because it is produced.

Example—Whatever is eternal is not produced, as the soul.

Negative application.—Sound is not so (i.e., sound is not produced).

Conclusion.—Therefore sound is not eternal.


========================= START OF PAGE 38 =========================

THE NYAYA-SOTRAS. 13

39. Conclusion is the restatement of the proposition after the reason has been mentioned.

Conclusion is the confirmation of the proposition after the reason and the example have been mentioned.

Proposition —Sound is non-eternal.

Reason—Because it is produced.

Example—Whatever is produced is non-eternal, as a pot.

Application—So is sound (produced).

Conclusion.—Therefore sound is non-eternal.

॥ १। १।४०॥

40. Confutation, which is carried on for ascertaining the real character of a thing whose character is not known, is reasoning which reveals the character by showing the absurdity of all contrary characters.

Is the soul eternal or non-eternal? Here the real character of the soul, whether it is eternal or non-eternal, is not known. In ascertaining the character, we reason as follows: If the soul were non-eternal, it would be impossible for it to enjoy the fruits of its own actions, to undergo transmigration, and to attain final release. But such a conclusion is absurd; such possibilities are known to belong to the soul; therefore, we must admit that the soul is eternal.

॥ १।१।४१॥

41. Ascertainment is the removal of doubt and the determination of a question by hearing two opposite sides.

A person wavers and doubts if certain statements are advanced to him by one of two parties, but opposed by the other party. His doubt is not removed until, by the application of reasons, he can vindicate either of the parties. The process by which the vindication is effected is called ascertainment. Ascertainment is not, however, in all cases preceded by doubt; for instance, in the case of perception, things are ascertained directly. So also we ascertain things directly by the authority of scriptures or through discussion. But in the case of investigation, doubt must precede ascertainment.

पमाणतक्कैसाधनोपालम्भस्सिद्धान्तुषिरुद्धः पञ्चावयवोपपन्नः
पत्तप्रतिपक्तपरिमहो “वादः” ॥ १।२।१॥

Discussion is the adoption of one of two opposing sides. What is adopted is analyzed in the form of five members, and defended by the aid of any of the means of right knowledge, while its opposite is assailed by confutation, without deviation from the established tenets.

A dialogue or disputation (katha) is the adoption of a side by a disputant and its opposite by his opponent.  A disputant is one who engages himself in a disputation as a means of seeking the truth.

An instance of discussion is given below:

Discutient—There is soul.

Opponent—There is no soul.

Discutient —Soul is existent (proposition).

Because it is an abode of consciousness (reason).

Whatever is not existent is not an abode of consciousness, as a hare’s horn (negative example).

Soul is not so; that is, soul is an abode of consciousness (negative application).

Therefore soul is existent (conclusion).

Opponent—Soul is non-existent (proposition).

Because, etc.

Discutient—The scripture, which is a verbal testimony, declares the existence of soul.

Discutient—If there were no soul, it would not be possible to apprehend one and the same object through sight and touch.

Discutient—The doctrine of soul harmonizes well with the various tenets which we hold, viz., that there are eternal things, that everybody enjoys pleasure or suffers pain according to his own actions, etc. Therefore there is soul.


========================= START OF PAGE 40 =========================

THE NYAYA-SUTRAS. 15

The discussion will be considerably lengthened if the opponent happens to be a Buddhist who does not admit the authority of scripture and holds that there are no eternal things.

॥५१।२।२॥
2. Wrangling, which aims at gaining victory, is the defense or attack of a proposition in the manner aforesaid by quibbles, futilities, and other processes which deserve rebuke.

A wrangler is one who, engaged in a disputation, aims only at victory, being indifferent whether the arguments which he employs support his own contention or that of his opponent, provided that he can make out a pretext for bragging that he has taken an active part in the disputation.

॥ ५ १।२।३॥
3. Cavil is a kind of wrangling which consists in mere attacks on the opposite side. A caviller does not endeavor to establish anything, but confines himself to mere carping at the arguments of his opponent.

॥१।२।४॥

4.  Faults of a reason are the erratic, the contradictory, the equal to the question, the unproved, and the mistimed.

॥ १।२।५॥

9. The erratic is the reason which leads to more than one conclusion.

An instance of the erratic is given below:
Proposition—sound is eternal.
Erratic reason—Because it is intangible.
Example—Whatever is intangible is eternal, as atoms.
Application—So is sound (intangible).
Conclusion—Therefore sound is eternal.


========================= START OF PAGE 41 =========================

BOOK I, CHAPTER II.

Again:

Proposition—Sound is non-eternal.

Erratic reason.—Because it is intangible.

Example.—Whatever is intangible is non-eternal, as intellect.

Application.—So is sound (intangible).

Conclusion.—Therefore sound is non-eternal (intangible).

Herefrom the reason, there have been drawn two opposite conclusions, viz.: that sound is eternal, and that sound is non-eternal. The reason or middle term is erratic when it is not pervaded by the major term, that is, when there is no universal connection between the major term and middle term, as pervader and pervaded. Intangible is pervaded neither by ‘eternal’ nor by ‘non-eternal.’ In fact, there is no universal connection between ‘intangible’ and ‘eternal’ or ‘non-eternal.’

6. The contradictory is the reason which opposes what is to be established.
Proposition.—A pot is produced.
Contradictory reason.—Because it is eternal.
Here the reason is contradictory because that which is eternal is never produced.

7. Equal to the question is the reason which provokes the very question for the solution of which it was employed.

Proposition.—Sound is non-eternal.

Reason which is equal to the question.—Because it is not possessed of the attribute of eternity.
‘Non-eternal’ is the same as ‘not possessed of the attribute of eternity.’ In determining the question whether sound is non-eternal, the reason given is that sound is non-eternal, or in other words, the reason begs the question.

8. The unproved is the reason which stands in need of proof in the same way as the proposition does.


========================= START OF PAGE 42 =========================

THE NYAYA-SUTRAS. 17

Proposition—Shadow is a substance.

Unproved reason—Because it possesses motion.

Here, unless it is actually proved that shadow possesses motion, we cannot accept it as the reason for the proposition that shadow is a substance. Just as the proposition stands in need of proof, so does the reason itself. It is possible that the motion belongs to the person who causes that obstruction of light which is called shadow.


50. The mistimed is the reason which is adduced when the time is past in which it might hold good.—9.

Proposition—Sound is durable.

Mistimed reason—Because it is manifested by union, as a color.

The color of a jar is manifested when the jar comes into union with a lamp, but the color existed before the union took place and will continue to exist after the union has ceased. Similarly, the sound of a drum is manifested when the drum comes into union with a rod, and the sound must, after the analogy of the color, be presumed to have existed before the union took place and to continue to exist after the union has ceased. Hence, sound is durable. The reason adduced here is mistimed because the manifestation of sound does not take place at the time when the drum comes into union with the rod, but at a subsequent moment when the union has ceased. In the case of color, however, the manifestation takes place just at the time when the jar comes into union with the lamp. Because the time of their manifestation is different, the analogy between color and sound is not complete; therefore, the reason is mistimed.

Some interpret the aphorism as follows: The mistimed is the reason which is adduced in a wrong order among the five members, for instance, as if the reason is stated before the proposition. But this interpretation, according to Vatsyayana, is wrong, for a word bears its legitimate connection with another word (in a Sanskrit sentence) even if they are placed at a distance from each other, and, on the other hand, even the closest proximity is of no use if the words are disconnected in their sense. Moreover, the placing of members in a wrong order is noticed in the Nyaya-sutra as a nigrahasthana (occasion for rebuke) called aprapta-kala (inopportune).


51. Quibble is the opposition offered to a proposition by the assumption of an alternative meaning.—10.
* (Quoted by Vatsyayana in the Nyaya-bhashya, p. 250).


========================= START OF PAGE 43 =========================

BOOK 1, CHAPTER 1.

52. Quibble is of three kinds, namely, quibble in respect of a term, quibble in respect of a genus, and quibble in respect of a metaphor.

प्रविरोषाभिहितेऽे वक्तुरभिभायादथौन्तरकल्पना “वाकूल-

MAA? ॥ १।२।१२॥

53. Quibble in respect of a term consists in wilfully taking the term in a sense other than that intended by a speaker who has happened to use it ambiguously.

A speaker says: “This boy is nava-kambala (possessed of a new blanket).”
A quibbler replies: “This boy is not certainly nara-kambala (possessed of nine blankets) for he has only one blanket.” Here the word *nava*, which is ambiguous, was used by the speaker in the sense of “new,” but has been wilfully taken by the quibbler in the sense of “nine.”

सम्भवतोऽर्थस्यातिसामान्ययोगादसम्भूताथकल्पना “सामा-

54. Quibble in respect of a genus consists in asserting the impossibility of a thing which is really possible, on the ground that it belongs to a certain genus which is very wide.

A speaker says: “This Brahman is possessed of learning and conduct.”

An objector replies: “It is impossible, for how can it be inferred that this person is possessed of learning and conduct because he is a Brahman? There are little boys who are Brahmans, yet not possessed of learning and conduct.”

Here the objector is a quibbler, for he knows well that possession of learning and conduct was not meant to be an attribute of the whole class of Brahmans, but it was ascribed to this particular Brahman.

55. Quibble in respect of a metaphor consists in denying the proper meaning of a word by taking it literally while it was used metaphorically, and vice versa.—14.
A speaker says: “The scaffolds cry out.”

An objector replies: ‘It is impossible for scaffolds to cry out, for they are inanimate objects.’

Therefore, the objector is a quibbler, for he knew well that the word “scaffold” was used to signify those standing on the scaffolds.

वाकूढलमेवोपचारच्छलं तंदविशेषात्‌ ॥ १।२। १५॥
56. It may be said that quibble in respect of a metaphor is in reality quibble in respect of a term, for the first is not different from the second.—15.

नं तदथौन्तरभावात्‌ ॥ १।२। १६॥
57. But it is not so, for there is a distinction between them.—16.

Words are taken in their direct (literal) meanings in the case of ‘quibble in respect of a term,’ while they are taken in their direct (literal) as well as indirect (secondary) meanings in the case of ‘quibble in respect of a metaphor.’

सागा वा किञ्चित्साधम्यादेकच्छलम्रसङ्कः ॥ १।२। १७॥

58. If you do not admit that one is different from another simply because there is some similarity between them, then we should have only one kind of quibble.—17.

If ‘quibble in respect of a metaphor’ were not different from ‘quibble in respect of a term,’ then these two also would not be different from ‘quibble in respect of a genus,’ because there is some similarity among all of them. This is absurd; hence the three kinds of quibble are different from one another.

59. Futility consists in offering objections founded on mere similarity or dissimilarity.

A disputant says: “The soul is inactive because it is all-pervading as ether.”

His opponent replies: “If the soul is inactive because it bears similarity to ether as being all-pervading, why is it not active because it bears similarity to a pot as being a seat of union?”

The reply is futile because it overlooks the universal connection between the middle term and the major term, which is existent in the arguments of the disputant but wanting in the arguments of the opponent. Whatever is all-pervading is inactive, but whatever is a seat of union is not necessarily active.

Or again:
Disputant—Sound is non-eternal because, unlike ether, it is a product.

Opponent—If sound is non-eternal because, as a product, it is dissimilar to ether, why is it not eternal because, as an object of auditory perception, it is dissimilar to a pot?

The reply is futile because it overlooks the universal disconnection between the middle term and the absence of the major term. There is a universal disconnection between “a product” and “not non-eternal,” but there is no such disconnection between “an object of auditory perception” and “not eternal.”

60. An occasion for rebuke arises when one misunderstands or does not understand at all.

If a person begins to argue in a way which betrays his utter ignorance, or wilfully misunderstands and yet persists in showing that he understands well, it is of no avail to employ counter-arguments. He is quite unfit to be argued with, and there is nothing left for his opponent but to turn him out or quit his company, rebuking him as a blockhead or a knave.

An instance of occasion for rebuke:

Whatever is not quality is substance.

Because there is nothing except colour, etc. (quality).

A person who argues in the above way is to be rebuked as a fool, for his reason (which admits only quality) opposes his proposition (which admits both quality and substance).

Another instance:

Disputant—Fire is not hot.
Opponent—But the evidence of touch disproves such a statement.

Disputant, in order to gain the confidence of the assembled people, says—‘O learned audience, listen; I do not say that fire is not hot.’

It is only meet that the opponent should quit the company of a man who argues in this way.

========================= START OF PAGE 47 =========================

22 BOOK II, CHAPTER I.

62. Some say that doubt cannot arise from the recognition of common and uncommon properties, whether conjointly or separately.—1.

Conjointly.—It is said that doubt about an object is never produced if both the common and uncommon properties of the object are recognized. For instance, if we see in the twilight a tall object which moves, we do not doubt whether it is a man or a post. We at once decide that it is a man, for though tallness is a property possessed in common by man and post, locomotion is a property which distinguishes a man from a post.

Separately.—Likewise, doubt about an object is said never to be produced if only the common or the uncommon properties are recognized. For instance, if we see a tall object in the twilight, we have no reason to doubt whether it is a man or a post. Tallness is certainly a property possessed in common by man and post, but the tallness of a man is not identical with that of a post; it merely resembles it. Now, the knowledge of similarity between the tallness of a man and that of a post presupposes a knowledge of the man and the post, of which the two kinds of tallness are attributes. If there is already a knowledge of the man and the post, there cannot be any doubt about them, for knowledge is the vanquisher of doubt.

63. It is further said that doubt cannot arise either from conflicting testimony or from the irregularity of perception and non-perception.—2.

64. In the case of conflicting testimony, there is, according to them, a strong conviction (on each side).—3. Suppose a disputant (Naiyāyika) says: there is a soul. His opponent (Buddhist) replies: there is no soul. The disputant and his opponent are quite sure that their respective statements are correct. Hence there is no doubt, but on the contrary, there is conviction in the minds of both.


========================= START OF PAGE 48 =========================

THE NYAYA-SOTRAS. 23

65. Doubt, they say, does not arise from the irregularity of perception and non-perception, because in the irregularity itself there is regularity.

An irregularity may be designated as such with reference to something else, but with reference to itself, it is a settled fact. If the irregularity is settled in itself, it is regular and cannot cause doubt. On the other hand, if the irregularity is not settled in itself, it is devoid of its own character and cannot cause doubt.


66. Likewise, they say, there is the chance of endless doubt owing to the continuity of its cause. Recognition of properties common to many objects is, for instance, a cause of doubt. The common properties continue to exist and hence, they say, there will be no cessation of doubt.

67. In reply, it is stated that the recognition of properties common to many objects, etc., are certainly causes of doubt if there is no reference to the precise characters of the objects; there is no chance of no doubt or of endless doubt.

It is admitted that doubt does not arise from the recognition of common and uncommon properties conjointly. Aphorism 2-1-1 brings forth the objection that doubt is not produced even by the recognition of common or uncommon properties alone. It is said that while we see a tall object in the twilight, we at once think of a man and a post, both of which are tall. Thus, there is knowledge rather than doubt about the man and post suggested by the tall object. The present aphorism dismisses the objection by stating that there is certainly common (non-distinctive) knowledge about a man and a post suggested by the tall object, but there is no precise (distinctive) knowledge about them. Precise knowledge (that is, knowledge of the precise character which distinguishes a man from a post) being absent, doubt must arise. Similar arguments will apply to doubt arising from the recognition of non-common properties alone.


========================= START OF PAGE 49 =========================

24 BOOK II, CHAPTER I.

Aphorisms 2-1-2 and 2-1-3 raise the objection that doubt does not arise from conflicting testimony, as the disputant and his opponent are both confident of their respective contentions. The present aphorism disposes of the objection by pointing out that in the case of conflicting statements, one is led to believe that both statements are worth consideration but is unable to penetrate into the precise character of the statements. Hence, though the disputant and his opponent remain fixed, the umpire and the audience are thrown into doubt by their conflicting statements.

Aphorism 2-1-4 raises the objection that doubt cannot arise from the irregularity of perception and non-perception as the irregularity is settled in itself. The present aphorism meets the objection by stating that the irregularity cannot be concealed by mere verbal tricks. The irregularity, though settled in itself, does not lose its own character until the objects which cause it are removed.

Aphorism 2-1-5 gives rise to the fear that there is the possibility of endless doubt inasmuch as the cause is continuous. The present aphorism removes the fear by stating that though materials of doubt, such as common properties, etc., continue to exist, we do not always recognize them. Unless there is recognition of the common properties, etc., there cannot be doubt.

यत्र संशयस्तत्रैवमुत्तरोत्तरपसङ्गः ॥ २। १।७॥
68. Examination should be made of each case where there is room for doubt.—7.

It has been stated that knowledge about the true nature of the categories consists in the true knowledge of their enunciation, definition, and examination. In case of well-known facts admitted by all, there should be no examination. We are to examine only those cases where there is room for doubt. The author explains, therefore, first the nature of doubt, and then proceeds to examine the other categories, lest there should be any room for doubt in them.

परत्यक्लादीनामध्रामारयं ARMAS: ॥ २।१।८॥
69. Perception and other means of knowledge, says an objector, are invalid as they are impossible at all three times.—8.

According to the objector, perception is impossible at the present, past, and future times, or in other words, perception can neither be prior to, nor posterior to, nor simultaneous with, the objects of sense.


========================= START OF PAGE 50 =========================

70. If perception occurred anteriorly, it could not, he says, have arisen from the contact of a sense with its object.

With reference to the perception of color, for instance, it is asked whether the color precedes perception or the perception precedes color. If you say that perception occurred anteriorly or preceded the color, you must give up your definition of perception, viz., that perception arises from the contact of a sense with its object.

71. If perception is supposed to occur posteriorly, you cannot, he continues, maintain the conclusion that objects of sense are established by perception.

The objection stands thus: The means of right knowledge are stated by you to be perception, inference, comparison, and verbal testimony. All objects of right knowledge are said to be established by them. The objects of sense, for instance, are supposed to be established by perception: color is said to be established by visual perception. This conclusion will have to be abandoned if you say that perception occurs posteriorly to the objects.

युगपस्सिद्धौ परत्यर्थनियतत्वात्रमदृत्तित्वाभावो बुद्धीनाम्‌
॥ २।१।११॥

72. If perception were simultaneous with its object, there would not, says the objector, be any order of succession in our cognitions as there is no such order in their corresponding objects.

Various objects of sense can coexist at one time, e.g., color and smell exist in a flower at the same time. If we hold that perception is simultaneous with its object, we must admit that the color and the smell can be perceived at the same time, that is, our perception of color must be admitted to be simultaneous with our perception of smell. This is absurd because two acts of perception, nay, two cognitions, cannot take place simultaneously.


========================= START OF PAGE 51 =========================

26 BOOK 7, CHAPTER 1.

As there is an order of succession in our cognitions, perception cannot be simultaneous with its object. The aphorism may also be explained as follows:

In knowing a color, we perform, we may say, two kinds of knowledge simultaneously, viz., perception and inference. As soon as our eye comes in contact with the color, perception results which does not, however, enable us to be aware of the color. The color is brought home to us by inference which, we may say, is performed simultaneously with the perception. Now, says the objector, perception and inference being two different kinds of knowledge cannot be simultaneous, as the mind, which is an atomic substance, cannot be instrumental in producing more than one kind of knowledge at a time.—11.

त्रैकाल्यासिद्धः प्रतिषेधानुपपत्तिः ॥ २। १।१२॥

73. In reply, it is stated that if perception and other means of right knowledge are impossible, the denial of them is also impossible.—12.

Owing to the absence of the matter to be denied, the denial is inoperative.

प्रतिषेधासिद्धिः ॥ २। १। १३ ॥

74. Moreover, the denial itself cannot be established if you deny all means of right knowledge.—13.

If you are to establish anything (e.g., denial), you can do so only by one or more of the means of right knowledge, viz., perception, inference, comparison, etc. If you deny them, there will be nothing left which will lead you to the establishment of the thing. Hence you will not be able to establish the denial itself.

तत्प्रामाण्ये न सर्वप्रमाणप्रतिषेधः ॥ २।१।१४॥

75. If you say that your denial is based on a certain means of right knowledge, you do thereby acknowledge the validity of the means.—14.

Suppose you deny a thing because it is not perceived. You thereby acknowledge that perception is a means of right knowledge. Similarly, inference, etc., are also to be acknowledged as means of right knowledge.


========================= START OF PAGE 52 =========================

THE NYAYA-SUTRAS, 27

76. The means of right knowledge cannot, therefore, be denied. They are established in the manner that a drum is proved by its sound.—15.

There is, says Vatsyayana, no fixed rule that the means of right knowledge should precede the objects of right knowledge or should succeed them or be simultaneous with them. The order of precedence is never uniform. Look at the analogous cases: a drum precedes its sound, and illumination succeeds the sun, while smoke is synchronous with fire.

77. The character of an object of right knowledge resembles that of a balance by which a thing is weighed.—16. Just as a balance is an instrument for measuring weight but is a measured object when it is itself weighed in another balance, so the senses, etc., are said to be instruments of right knowledge from one point of view, and objects of right knowledge from another point of view. The eye, for instance, is an instrument of perception as well as an object of perception. So also the means of right knowledge may, if occasion arises, be also regarded as objects of right knowledge.

78. If an object of right knowledge, continues the objector, is to be established by a means of right knowledge, this latter needs also to be established by another means of right knowledge.—17.

The objection stands thus: You say that an object of right knowledge is to be established by a means of right knowledge. I admit this and ask how you establish the means of right knowledge itself. Since a means of right knowledge may also be regarded as an object of right knowledge, you are required to establish the so-called means of right knowledge by another means of right knowledge and so on.

79. Or, he continues, if a means of right knowledge does not require another means of right knowledge for its establishment, let an object of right knowledge


========================= START OF PAGE 53 =========================

28, BOOK II, CHAPTER I.

It cannot be established without any means of right knowledge.

A means of right knowledge stands in the same category as an object of right knowledge, if you are to establish either of them. If the means of right knowledge is accepted as self-established, the object of right knowledge must also, according to the objector, be accepted as self-established. In such a contingency, perception, inference, etc., will be superfluous.

न प्रदीपपरकाशवत्तस्सिद्धेः ॥ २।१।१६॥

It is not so: the means of right knowledge are established like the illumination of a lamp.

A lamp illuminates a jar, and our eye illuminates the lamp. Though it is sometimes the lamp and sometimes the eye that illuminates, you are bound to admit a general notion of illuminator. Similarly, you must admit a general notion of the means of right knowledge as distinguished from that of the objects of right knowledge. The means will not, of course, be regarded as such when included under the category of an object.

[The aphorism is also interpreted as follows: Just as a lamp illuminates itself and other objects, the means of right knowledge establish themselves and the objects of right knowledge. Hence perception establishes itself and the objects of sense.]

Note.—Objections raised in aphorisms 8, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, and 18 emanated from the Buddhist philosophy. The reply given in aphorisms 12, 13, 14, 15, and 19 represents the views of Brahmanic philosophers who regard perception as a real entity and objects as self-existent entities.  According to the Buddhist philosophers, however, neither perception nor objects have any self-existence. They acquire an apparent or conditional existence in virtue of a certain relation which exists between them. Cause and effect, long and short, prior and posterior, etc., are all relative terms. The whole world is a network of relations. The relations themselves are illusory, as the objects which are related have no self-existence. Hence the world is an illusion or has a mere conditional existence. But where there is conditionality, there is no truth. Truth and conditionality are incompatible terms. That which neutralizes all relations is the void or absolute which lies beyond the conditional world. To speak the truth, the world is an absolute nothing, though it has a conditional existence.


An objector may say that the definition of perception as given before is untenable because incomplete.


========================= START OF PAGE 54 =========================

THE NYAYA-SUTRAS. 29

Perception has been defined as knowledge which arises from the contact of a sense with its object. This definition is said to be defective because it does not include the conjunction of soul with mind, and of mind with sense, which are causes of perception.

82. Perception, it is said, cannot arise unless there is conjunction of soul with mind.—21.

From the contact of a sense with its object, no knowledge arises unless, it is said, there is also conjunction of soul with mind. A sense coming into contact with its object produces knowledge in our soul only if the sense is conjoined with the mind. Hence the conjunction of soul with mind should be mentioned as a necessary element in the definition of perception.

84. Were it so, we reply, then direction, space, time and ether should also be enumerated among the causes of perception.— 22.

Direction, space, time, and ether are also indispensable conditions in the production of knowledge. But even the objector does not feel the necessity of enumerating these among the causes of perception.

84. The soul, we point out, has not been excluded from our definition inasmuch as knowledge is a mark of the soul.—23.

Perception has been described as knowledge, and knowledge implies the soul which is its abode. Consequently, in speaking of knowledge, the soul has, by implication, been mentioned as a condition in the production of perception.

85. The mind too has not been omitted from our definition inasmuch as we have spoken of the non-simultaneity of acts of knowledge.— 24.

Perception has been defined as knowledge. An essential characteristic of knowledge is that more than one act of knowing cannot take place at a time. This characteristic is due to the mind, an atomic substance.


========================= START OF PAGE 55 =========================

30 BOOK II, CHAPTER I.

Which is conjoined with the sense, when knowledge is produced. Hence, in speaking of knowledge, we have by implication mentioned the mind as a condition of perception.

॥२।१।२५॥
86. The contact of a sense with its object is mentioned as the special cause of perception.—25.

There are many kinds of knowledge, such as perception, recollection, etc. Conjunction of soul with mind is a cause which operates in the production of all kinds of knowledge, while the contact of a sense with its object is the cause which operates only in perception. In our definition of perception, we have mentioned only the special cause and have omitted the common causes which precede not only perception but also other kinds of knowledge.

॥ २। १।२६॥

87. The contact of a sense with its object is certainly the main cause as perception is produced even when one is asleep or inattentive.—26.

Even a sleeping person hears the thundering of a cloud if his ear is open to it, and a careless person experiences heat if his skin is exposed to it.

[Aphorisms 25 and 26 are omitted by Vatsyāyana, the earliest commentator, but are noticed by Udyotakara, Vācaspati, Viśvanātha and other subsequent annotators].

तेश्चापदेशो ज्ञानविशेषाणाम्‌ ॥२।१।२७॥
88. By the senses and their objects are also distinguished the special kinds of knowledge.—27.

The special kinds of knowledge are the five varieties of perception, viz., by sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. These are distinguished by the senses in whose spheres they are, or by the objects which they illuminate. Thus, the visual perception is called eye-knowledge or color-knowledge, the auditory perception is called ear-knowledge or sound-knowledge, the olfactory perception is called nose-knowledge or smell-knowledge, the gustatory perception is called tongue-knowledge or taste-knowledge, and the tactual perception is called skin-knowledge or touch-knowledge.


========================= START OF PAGE 56 =========================

THE NYAYA-SOTRAS. $1.

89. It may be objected that the contact of a sense with its object is not the cause of perception, as it is inefficient in some instances.—28.

An objector may say that the contact of a sense with its object is not the cause of perception, as we find that a person listening to a song may not see color, though it comes in contact with his eye.


90. It is not so because there is pre-eminence of some particular object.—29.

It is admitted that a person while listening to a song may not see color, though it comes in contact with his eye. Yet the instance does not prove that the contact of a sense with its object is not the cause of perception, for it is to be understood that his intent listening prevents him from seeing the color. In other words, the auditory perception supersedes the visual perception because the song is more attractive than the color.


91. Perception, it may be urged, is inference because it illuminates only a part as a mark of the whole.—30.

We are said to perceive a tree while we really perceive only a part of it. This knowledge of the tree, as a whole, derived from the knowledge of a part of it is, according to the objectors, a case of inference.


========================= START OF PAGE 57 =========================

32 “BOOK Tt, CHAPTER 1
T TTA यावत्तावदप्युपलम्भात्‌ ॥२।१।३१॥

92. But this is not so, for perception is admitted of at least that portion which it actually illuminates.—31.
The objectors themselves admit that a part is actually perceived. Hence, perception as a means of knowledge is not altogether denied and it is accepted as different from inference.

न चैकदेशोपलब्धिरवयविसद्भावात्‌ ॥ २। १।३९॥
93. Moreover, the perception is not merely of a part, for there is a whole behind the part.—32.
The perception of a part does not exclude perception of the whole of which it is a part. If you touch the hand, leg, or any other limb of a person, you are said to touch the person. Similarly, if you perceive a part of a thing, you are said to perceive the thing. A part implies the whole, and perception of a part implies perception of the whole.

साध्यत्वादवयविनि सन्देहः ॥ २।१।३३॥

94. There is, some say, doubt about the whole, because the whole has yet to be established.—33.
The objectors say that parts alone are realities and that there is no whole behind them. A tree, for instance, is yellow in some parts and green in other parts. If the tree were one whole, then the contradictory qualities of yellowness and greenness could not have belonged to it simultaneously. Hence, the parts alone must, according to them, be regarded as real.

सव्वाग्रहणमवयग्यसिदधेः ॥२। C1 ३४॥
95. If there were no whole, there would, it is replied, be non-perception of all.—34.
All signifies substance, quality, action, generality, particularity, and intimate relation. None of these would be perceptible if the whole were denied. Suppose that the parts alone are real. Then, since a part is not of fixed dimension, it may itself be divided into parts, these latter again into further parts, and so on until we reach the atoms which are the ultimate parts. Now the atoms, which possess no bulk, are not perceptible. Similarly, the quality, action, etc., which inhere in the atoms are also not perceptible. Consequently, if we deny that there is a ‘whole,’ neither the substance nor quality, etc., would be perceptible.


========================= START OF PAGE 58 =========================

THE NYAYA-SOTRAS.  38

96. There is a whole because we can hold, pull, etc.—35.
If there were no whole, we could not have held or pulled an entire thing by holding or pulling a part of it. We say, ‘one jar,’ ‘one man,’ etc. This use of ‘one’ would vanish if there were no whole.

97. The illustration from an army or a forest does not hold good, for atoms cannot be detected by the senses.—36.

If anyone were to say that just as a single soldier or a single tree may not be seen from a distance, but an army consisting of numerous soldiers or a forest consisting of numerous trees is seen, so a single atom may not be perceptible but a jar consisting of numerous atoms will be perceptible, and these atoms being called ‘one jar,’ the use of ‘one’ will not vanish. The analogy, we reply, does not hold good because the soldiers and trees possess bulk and so are perceptible, whereas the atoms do not possess bulk and are individually not perceptible. It is absurd to argue that because soldiers and trees are perceptible in the mass, atoms are perceptible in the mass also: to avoid this conclusion, we must admit the existence of a whole beyond the parts.

98. Inference, some say, is not a means of right knowledge as it errs in certain cases, e.g., when a river is banked, when something is damaged, and when similarity misleads, etc.—37.

If we see a river swollen, we infer that there has been rain; if we see the ants carrying off their eggs, we infer that there will be rain; and if we hear a peacock scream, we infer that clouds are gathering. These inferences, says an objector, are not necessarily correct, for a river may be swollen because embanked, the ants may carry off their eggs because their nests have been damaged, and the so-called screaming of a peacock may be nothing but the voice of a man.


99. It is not so, because our inference is based on something else than the part, fear, and likeness.—38.


========================= START OF PAGE 59 =========================

34 BOOK II, CHAPTER I.

The swelling of a river caused by rain is different from that which results from the embankment of a part of it; the former is attended by a great rapidity of currents, an abundance of foam, a mass of fruits, leaves, wood, etc. The manner in which ants carry off their eggs just before rain is quite different from the manner in which they do so when their nests are damaged. The ants run away quickly in a steady line when rain is imminent, but fear makes them fly in disorder when their nests are damaged. The screaming of a peacock which suggests gathering clouds is quite different from a man’s imitation of it, for the latter is not natural. If, in such cases, any wrong inference is drawn, the fault is in the person, not in the process.

वत्तमानाभावः पवतः पतितपतितव्यकालोपपत्तेः ॥२।१।३९॥

100. There is, some say, no present time—because when a thing falls we can know only the time through which it has fallen and the time through which it will yet fall.—39.

Inference has reference to three times. In the a priori inference, we pass from the past to the present; in the a posteriori, from the present to the past; and in the ‘commonly seen,’ from the present to the present. It is, therefore, proper that we should examine the three times. The reason which leads some people to deny the present time is that when a fruit, for instance, falls from a tree, we recognize only the past time taken up by the fruit in traversing a certain distance and the future time which will yet be taken up by the fruit in traversing the remaining distance. There is no intervening distance which the fruit can traverse at the so-called present time. Hence, they say there is no present time.

तयोरप्यभावो वत्तैमानाभावे तदपे्तत्वात्‌ ॥२। १।४०॥
101. If there is no present time, it is replied, there will be no past and future times because they are related to it.—40.

The past is that which precedes the present, and the future is that which succeeds it. Hence, if there is no present time, there cannot be any past or future time.

नातीतानागतयोरितरेतरपेच्लासिद्धिः ॥२।१।४९१
102. The past and future cannot be established by a mere mutual reference.—41.


========================= START OF PAGE 60 =========================

THE NYAYA-SOTRAS. 35

If the past is defined as that which is not the future, and the future is defined as that which is not the past, the definition would involve a fallacy of mutual dependency. Hence we must admit the present time to which the past and future are related.

वत्तेमानाभावे सव्वा्रहणम्भत्य्तानुपपत्तेः ॥२। ९।५४२॥

103. If there were no present time, sense perception would be impossible; knowledge would be impossible.—42.

If you deny the present time, there cannot be any perception which illuminates only what is present in time; and in the absence of perception, all kinds of knowledge would be impossible. Hence the present time is established by confutation or the principle of *reductio ad absurdum*.

104. We can know both the past and the future, for we can conceive of a thing as made and as about to be made.—43.

The present time is indicated by what continues, the past by what has been finished, and the future by what has not yet begun.

WAHANARATAT FASTA: ॥२। १।५४५।

105. Comparison, some say, is not a means of right knowledge, as it cannot be established either through complete, considerable, or partial similarity.—44.

On the ground of complete similarity, we never say “a cow is like a cow,” on the ground of considerable similarity we do not say that “a buffalo is like a cow,” and on the ground of partial similarity we do not say that “a mustard seed is like Mount Meru.” Hence comparison is regarded by some as not a means of right knowledge, for it has no precise standard.

पूसिदधसाधम्यादुपमानसिद्धेयथोक्तदोषानुपपत्तिः ॥२। १।४५५॥
106. This objection does not hold good, for comparison is established through similarity in a high degree.—45.

The similarity in a high degree exists between such well-known objects as a cow and a bos gavaeus, etc.


========================= START OF PAGE 61 =========================

CHAPTER I.

पूत्यचतेणापूत्यच्षसिद्धेः ॥ २। १।५६॥

107. Comparison, some say, is not different from inference, for both seek to establish the unperceived by means of the perceived.

We recognize a bos gavaeus at first sight through its special similarity to a cow which we have often perceived. This knowledge of a previously unperceived object, derived through its similarity to a perceived object, is, it has been said, nothing but a case of inference.

108. It is not in a bos gavaeus unperceived that we find the real matter of comparison.

The matter of comparison is similarity, e.g., between a cow and a bos gavaeus. The bos gavaeus in which we notice the similarity is first perceived; that is, on perceiving a bos gavaeus we notice its similarity to a cow. Hence comparison supplies us with knowledge of a perceived thing through its similarity to another thing also perceived. This characteristic distinguishes it from inference, which furnishes us with knowledge of an unperceived thing through that of a thing perceived.

तथेत्युपसंहारादुपमानसिद्धेनोविशेष
; ॥२।१।४८॥

109. There is no non-difference inasmuch as comparison is established through the compendious expression.

It is not true that comparison is identical with inference because the former is established through the compendious expression “so.” ‘As is a cow, so is a bos gavaeus’—this is an instance of comparison. This use of ‘so’ makes it clear that comparison is a distinct means of right knowledge.

शब्वोऽनुमानमर्थस्यानुपलब्धेरनुमेयत्वात्‌ ॥२।१।५९॥

110. Verbal testimony, some say, is inference because the object revealed by it is not perceived but inferred. Inference gives us the knowledge of an unperceived object through the knowledge of an object which is perceived. Similarly, verbal testimony enables us to acquire the knowledge of an unperceived object.


========================= START OF PAGE 62 =========================

THE NYAYA-SOTRAS.

Through the knowledge of a word which is perceived, verbal testimony is, therefore, supposed by some to be inference, as the object revealed by both is unperceived.


III. In respect of perceptibility, the two cases are not, continues the objector, different.—50

In inference as well as in verbal testimony, we pass to an unperceived object through an object which is perceived. In respect of the perceptibility of the object through which we pass, inference does not, continues the objector, differ from verbal testimony.


112. There is, moreover, adds the objector, the same connection.—51.

Just as in inference there is a certain connection between a sign (e.g., smoke) and the thing signified by it (e.g., fire), so in verbal testimony there is a connection between a word and the object signified by it. So inference, says the objector, is not different from verbal testimony.


113. In reply, we say that there is reliance on the matter signified by a word because the word has been used by a reliable person.—52

In reference to the objections raised in aphorisms 49 and 50, we say that we rely on unseen matter not simply because it is signified by words but because they are spoken by a reliable person.  There are, some say, paradise, nymphs, Uttarakurus, seven islands, ocean, human settlements, etc. We accept them as realities not because they are known through words, but because they are spoken of by persons who are reliable. Hence, verbal testimony is not inference. The two agree in conveying knowledge of an object through its sign, but the sign in one is different from the sign in the other. In the case of verbal testimony, the special point is to decide whether the sign (word) comes from a reliable person.

Aphorism 51 speaks of a certain connection between a word and the object signified by it. The present aphorism points out that the connection is not a natural one. We acknowledge that a word indicates a certain object, but we deny that the object is naturally or necessarily connected with the word. Hearing, for instance, the word “cow,” we


========================= START OF PAGE 63 =========================

38 BOOK 77, CHAPTER L

Think of the animal signified by it; nevertheless, the word and the animal are not connected with each other by nature or necessity. In the case of inference, however, the connection between a sign (e.g., smoke) and the thing signified (e.g., fire) is natural and necessary. Therefore, the connection involved in inference is not of the same kind as that involved in verbal testimony.

्रमाणतोऽनुपलब्धेः ॥ २।१।५३॥
114. There is, in the case of verbal testimony, no perception of the connection.—53.

The connection between a sign and the thing signified, which is the basis of inference, is obvious to perception. For instance, the inference that “the hill is fiery because it is smoky” is based on a certain connection between smoke and fire which is actually perceived in a kitchen or elsewhere. The connection between a word and the objects signified by it, which is the basis of verbal testimony, is not obvious to perception. The word Uttarakuru, for instance, signifies the country of that name, but the connection between the word and the country is not perceived, as the latter lies beyond our observation. Hence verbal testimony is not inference.

पूरणपृवाहपाटनानुपलन्धेश्च सम्बन्धाभावः ॥ २।१।५४॥
115. There is no natural connection between a word and the object signified by it, as we do not find that the words food, fire, and hatchet are accompanied by the actions filling, burning, and splitting.—54.

If a word were naturally connected with the object signified by it, then by uttering the words food, fire, and hatchet we should have found our mouth filled up (with food), burnt (with fire), and split (by a hatchet). But such is never the case. Hence there is no natural connection between a word and the object signified by it, and consequently verbal testimony is not inference.

शस्कथव्यवस्थानावपूतिषेधः ॥२।१।५५॥
116. It cannot, says an objector, be denied that there is a fixed connection between words and their meanings.—55.
A particular word denotes a particular meaning, e.g., the word ‘cow’ denotes the animal of that name, but it does not denote a horse, a jar, or any other thing. Therefore, in the case of verbal testimony,


========================= START OF PAGE 64 =========================

THE NYAYA-SOTRAS. 39

A fixed connection between a word and its meaning exists, as in the case of inference, a fixed connection between a sign and the thing signified. Hence verbal testimony is considered by the objector to be a case of inference.

न सामयिकतवाच्छब्वाथसम्पूत्ययस्य ॥२।१।५६॥
117. We reply that it is through convention that the meaning of a word is understood.—56.

The connection between a word and its meaning is conventional and not natural. The connection, though fixed by man, is not inseparable and cannot therefore be the basis of an inference.

जातिविशेषे चानियमात्‌ ॥२।१। yon

118. There is no universal uniformity of connection between a word and its meaning.—57.
The Aryas, Fryas, and Mlecchas use the same word in different senses; e.g., the word “yava” is used by the Fryas to denote a long-awned grain but by the Mlecchas to denote a panic-seed. So the connection between a word and its meaning is not everywhere uniform and consequently verbal testimony cannot be considered as inference.

तदपूमाश्यमनृतव्याघातपुनरृक्तदोषेभ्यः ॥२। १।५८॥

119. The Veda, some say, is unreliable as it involves the faults of untruth, contradiction, and tautology.—58.
The Veda, which is a kind of verbal testimony, is not, some say, a means of right knowledge. It is supposed by them to be tainted with the faults of untruth, contradiction, and tautology. For instance, the Veda affirms that a son is produced when the sacrifice for the sake of a son is performed. It often happens that the son is not produced though the sacrifice has been performed. There are many contradictory injunctions in the Veda; e.g., it declares “let one sacrifice when the sun has risen,” also “let one sacrifice when the sun has not risen,” etc. There is such tautology as “let the first hymn be recited thrice,” “let the last hymn be recited thrice,” etc.

* न कमंकतसाधनवेयुण्यात्‌ ॥२।१।५९)॥

120. The so-called untruth in the Veda comes from some defect in the act, operator, or materials of sacrifice.—59.


========================= START OF PAGE 65 =========================

40 | BOOK 7

Defect in the act consists in sacrificing not according to rules; defect in the operator (officiating priest) consists in his not being a learned man; and defect in the materials consists in the fuel being wet, butter being not fresh, remuneration (to the officiating priest) being small, etc. A son is sure to be produced as a result of performing the sacrifice if these defects are avoided. Therefore, there is no untruth in the Veda.

शछभ्युपेत्य कालभेदे दोषवचनात्‌ ॥ २। १।६०॥
121. Contradiction would occur if there were alteration of the time agreed upon.—60

Let a person perform the sacrifice before sunrise or after sunrise if he has agreed upon doing it at either of the times. Two alternative courses being open to him, he can perform the sacrifice before sunrise or after sunrise according to his agreement or desire. The Veda cannot be charged with the fault of contradiction if it enjoins such alternative courses.

द्यसुवावोपपत्तेश्च ॥ २।१।६१॥

122. There is no tautology, because re-inculcation is of advantage.— 61.

Tautology means a useless repetition, which never occurs in the Veda. If there is any repetition, it is either for completing a certain number of syllables, or for explaining a matter briefly expressed, etc. “Let the first hymn be recited thrice,” “let the last hymn be recited thrice”—such instances embody a useful repetition.

It is necessary to divide the Vedic speech into classes based on special characters.

124. The Vedic speech being divided on the principle of injunction, persuasion and re-inculcation.—63.

The two main divisions of the Veda are (1) hymn and (2) ritual. The ritual portion admits of three subdivisions, viz., injunctive, persuasive and re-inculcative.


========================= START OF PAGE 66 =========================

HE NYAYA-SUTRAS.
(विधिः) विधायकः ॥ २१६४॥

125. An injunction is that which exhorts us to adopt a certain course of action [as the means of attaining good]. The following is an injunction: “Let him who desires paradise perform the fire-sacrifice.” This is a direct command.

126. Persuasion is effected through praise, blame, warning, and prescription. —65.

Praise is speech which persuades to a certain course of action by extolling its consequences, e.g., “By the Sarvajit sacrifice gods conquered all; there is nothing like the Sarvajit sacrifice; it enables us to obtain everything and to vanquish everyone, etc.” Here there is no direct command, but the Sarvajit sacrifice is extolled in such a way that we are persuaded to perform it.

Blame is speech which persuades us to adopt a certain course of action by acquainting us with the undesirable consequences of neglecting it, e.g., “One who performs any other sacrifice neglecting the Jyotistoma falls into a pit and decays there.” Here one is persuaded to perform the Jyotistoma sacrifice, the neglect of which brings about evil consequences.

Warning is the mentioning of a course of action the obstruction of which by some particular person led to bad consequences, e.g., on presenting oblation one is to take the fat first and the sprinkled butter afterwards, but alas! the Charaka priests first took the sprinkled butter which was, as it were, the life of the fire, etc. Here the foolish course of action adopted by the Charaka priests should serve as a warning to other priests who ought to avoid such a course.

Prescription implies the mention of something as commendable on account of its antiquity, e.g., “By this the Brahmanas recited the Sāma hymn, etc.”

विधिविहितघ्यानुषचनम्‌ (अनुवादः) ॥ २। १ । ६६ ॥
127. Re-inculcation is the repetition of that which has been enjoined by an injunction.—66.

Re-inculcation may consist of (1) the repetition of an injunction, or (2) the repetition of that which has been enjoined. The first is called verbal re-inculcation and the second objective re-inculcation. In the Veda


========================= START OF PAGE 67 =========================

42 ‘BOOK 77, CHAPTER I.

There is re-inculcation as in ordinary use there is repetition.  "Non-eternal, not eternal"—this is a verbal repetition. "Non-eternal, possessing the character of extinction"—this is objective repetition.

नानुवादपुनस्क्तयोविशेषः शर्दाभ्यासोपपत्तेः U २ । १ । ६७ ॥
| 128. There is, some say, no difference between re-inculcation and tautology, as there is in either case a repetition of some expression already used.—67.

Re-inculcation is supposed by some to be a fault inasmuch as it does not, according to them, differ from tautology.

शीघ्रतरगमनोपदेशवदभ्यासान्नाविशेषः WIP 1 eS ॥
129. There is a difference, because re-inculcation serves some useful purpose, e.g., a command to go faster.—68.
Tautology consists of a useless repetition, but the repetition in the case of re-inculcation is useful, e.g., ‘go on, go on’ signifies “go faster.”

मन्त्रायुर्वेदभामारयवच तत्प्रामारयमाप्तप्ामास्यात्‌ ॥२।१।६६॥
130. The Veda is reliable like the spell and medical science, because of the reliability of their authors.—69.

The spell counteracts poison, etc., and the medical science prescribes correct remedies. The authority which belongs to them is derived from their authors, the sages, who were reliable persons. The sages themselves were reliable because (1) they had an intuitive perception of truths, (2) they had great kindness for living beings, and (3) they had the desire of communicating their knowledge of the truths. The authors (lit., the seers and speakers) of the Veda were also the authors of the spell and medical science. Hence, like the spell and medical science, the Veda must be accepted as authoritative. The view that the Veda is authoritative because eternal is untenable.

न चतुष्मेतिद्याथापत्तिसम्भवाभावपूामार्यात्‌ ॥ २।१९। १ ॥

131. Some say that the means of right knowledge are more than four, because rumor, presumption, probability, and non-existence are also valid.

In Book I, chapter I, aphorism 3, the means of right knowledge have been stated to be four, viz., perception, inference, comparison, and verbal testimony. Some say that there are other means of right knowledge such as rumor, presumption, probability, and non-existence.

Rumor is an assertion that has come from one to another without any indication of the source from which it first originated, e.g., "In this fig tree there live goblins."

Presumption is the deduction of one thing from the declaration of another thing: e.g., from the declaration that "unless there is cloud there is no rain," we deduce that "there is rain if there is cloud." [A more familiar instance of presumption is this: the fat Devadatta does not eat during the daytime. Here the presumption is that he eats at night, for it is impossible for a person to be fat if he does not eat at all.]

Probability consists in cognizing the existence of a thing from that of another thing in which it is included, e.g., cognizing the measure of an adhaka from that of a drona of which it is a fourth part, and cognizing the measure of a prastha from that of an adhaka of which it is a quarter.

OF two opposite things, the non-existence of one establishes the existence of the other, e.g., the non-existence of rain establishes the combination of wind and cloud. When there is a combination of wind and cloud, drops of water cannot fall in spite of their weight.

ेतिह्यानथीन्तरभौवादनुमानेऽ्थापत्तिसम्भवाभावाना-
मन्थन्तरमावाच्चापूतिषेधः ॥ २।१।२॥

132. This, we reply, is no contradiction since rumor is included in verbal testimony, and presumption, probability, and non-existence are included in inference.

Those who maintain that rumor, presumption, probability, and non-existence are valid do not really oppose our division of the means of right knowledge into four, viz., perception, inference, comparison, and verbal testimony.


========================= START OF PAGE 69 =========================

44 ROOK 11, CHAPTER TI.

Rumor partakes of the general characteristics of verbal testimony and is a special kind of it.

Presumption is explained as the knowledge of a thing derived through the consideration of it from the opposite standpoint. For instance, the fat Devadatta does not eat during the daytime: here the presumption is that he eats at night. The fact of his eating at night has not been expressly stated but is ascertained from this consideration: a person who does not eat during the day cannot be strong unless he eats at night. It is evident that presumption, like inference, passes from a perceived thing to an unperceived one because they are in some way connected.

Probability is inference because it is the cognizance of a part from knowledge of a whole with which it is inseparably connected.

Non-existence is inference inasmuch as it really infers the obstruction of a cause from the non-existence of its effect through a certain connection; viz., if the obstruction occurs, the effect cannot occur.

Hence rumor, etc., are not independent means of right knowledge but are included in the four enumerated in Book I, Chapter 1, aphorism 3.

श्रथापत्तिरपूमाणमनेकान्तिकत्वात्‌ ॥२।१।३॥

138. Presumption, some say, is not valid because it leads to uncertainty.—3.

“If there is no cloud there will be no rain”—from this we are said to presume that if there is a cloud there will be rain. But it often happens that a cloud is not followed by rain. So presumption does not always lead to certainty.

च्रनर्थापत्ताव्थापत्त्यभिमानात्‌ ॥ २।१।४॥

134. We (लुक: if there is any uncertainty it is due to your supposing that to be a presumption which is not really so—4.

“If there is no cloud there will be no rain.” From this we are entitled to presume that if there is rain there must have been a cloud. But if you pretend to presume that “if there is a cloud there will be rain,” your so-called presumption will be invalid.

पूतिषेधाप्रामाख्यञ्चानेकान्तिकतात्‌ ॥ २ । १।५.॥

135. The objection itself, we say, is invalid because it leads to uncertainty.—5


========================= START OF PAGE 70 =========================

THE NYAYA-SOTRAS. | 48

“Presumption is not valid because it leads to uncertainty”—this is your objection.  It has two points for consideration: (1) the validity of presumption and (2) the existence of presumption. Your objection refers to only one point—the validity of presumption. So you do not deny the existence of presumption. In some instances, however, your objection may refer to more than one point. In fact, the nature of your objection is not definite in itself; in other words, it leads to uncertainty. Hence, your objection is invalid.

तस्पामारये वा नाथापत्त्यप्ामारयम्‌ ॥ २।१।६॥

136. Or, if that be valid, then our presumption is not invalid.—6.

Perhaps you will say that your objection is valid because you can ascertain in each case whether one or more points are referred to by the objection. Similarly, we shall say that our presumption is not invalid because we can ascertain in each case whether the presumption is capable of leading to more than one conclusion. Hence, if you say that your objection is valid, we shall say that our presumption is also valid.

नाभावप्रामाण्यं पमेयासिद्धेः ॥ २। ९।७॥

137. Some say that non-existence is not a means of right knowledge because there is no object which is known by it.—7.

लक्तितेष्वलज्णलक्तितत्वादलक्तितानां तत्पूमेयसिद्धिः ॥२।१। ८॥

138. Non-existence, we reply, serves to mark out an object unmarked by the mark which characterizes other objects.—8.

Suppose a person wants to bring a pot which is not blue. The absence of blueness is a mark which will enable him to mark out the particular pot he wants to bring and to exclude the other pots which are blue. Thus, an object may be known through the non-existence (absence) of its mark.

श्रसव्य्थे नाभाव इति चेन्नान्यलक्तणोपपत्तेः ॥ २ । १।६॥

139. If you say that the non-existence (absence) of a mark is impossible where there was no mark at all, it is, we reply, not so, because the non-existence (absence) is possible in reference to a mark elsewhere.—9.

-We can, says an objector, talk of a mark being non-existent (absent)
if it was previously existent (present). A pot is said to be not blue only
in- reference to its being blne previously. In reply we say that it is not
so. “Not-blue” is no doubt possible only in reference to “blue” but
that blueness may exist elsewhere. For instance, we can talk of this
pot being not-blue, in-contrast to that pot which is blue. .

तस्सिद्धरलक्तितेष्वहेतुः ॥ २ । १। १० ॥

140. Though a mark may distinguish the object
which is marked, the non-existence (absence) of the mark
cannot, some say, distinguish the object which is not
marked.—10.

A blue pot is distinguished by the blueness which is its mark. But
how can we, says the objector, distinguish an unmarked object by the
non-existence (absence) of the mark which it (०68 not possess ?

न लक्तणावस्थितापेन्तासिद्धेः॥ २।१।११॥

141. Thisis not so, because the non-existence (ab-
sence) ofa mark serves as a mark in relation to the pre-
sence of the mark.—I11

We can speak of a pot being not blue in relation to one which is
blue. Hence though not-blueness is not a positive mark it serves as a
(negative) mark in relation to blueness.

पाय॒ुत्पत्तरभावोपपत्तेश्च ॥ २।१। १२ ॥

142. Moreover we perceive non-existence as a mark
antecedent to the production of a thing.—12
There are two kinds of non-existence, viz., antecedent non-existence
and subsequent non-existence. When we say that there will be a jar,
we perceive the mark of non-existence of the jar in the halves which are
destined to compose it. This is antecedent non-existence. Similarly, when
we say that a jar has broken, we perceive the mark of non-existence of the
jar in the part which composed it. ‘This is subsequent non-existence.

Some say that sound is a quality of ether and that it is all-pervading,
eternal, and capable of being manifested. Others say that sound like
smell, etc., is a quality of the substance in which it abides, and is capable
of being manifested. Sound is said by others to be a quality of ether
and to be subject to production and destruction like knowledge. Others
again say that sound arises from the concussion of elements, requires no
abode, and is subject to production and destruction. Hence there arises
doubt about the true nature of sound.

144. Sound is not eternal because it has a beginning
and is cognised by our sense and is spoken of as artificial.-—
14.

Sound is non-eternal because it begins or arises from the concus-
sion of two hard substances e.g. an axe and a tree, ete. Another ground
for the non-eternality of sound is that it is cognised by our sense. More-
over we attribute to sound tho properties of an artificial object, eg., we
speak of a sound being grave, acute, etc. This would be impossible if
it had been eternal.

Some say that the so-called beginning of a sound jis merely a
manifestation of it, that is, sound docs not really begin but is amerely
manifested by the concussion of two lard substances. Inreply we say
that the concussion cloes not manifest but produces sound. You cannot
suppose the concussion to be the manifester and sound the manifested
unless yon can prove that the conenssion and sound are simultaneous.
But the proof is impessible as a sound is heard at a great distance even
after the concussion of the substances las ceased. So sound is not mani-
fested by the coneussion. It is, however, legitimate to suppose that sound
is produced by the concussion, and that one sound produces another sound
and so on until the last sound is heard at a great distance

the jar was broken is eternal (indestructible). Whatever is cognised by
our sense is non-eternal : this is also said to be an unsound argument.
When, for instance, we perceive a jar we perceive also its genus (२.९., jar-
ness) which is eternal. It is further said that we often attribute to eternal
things the properties of an artificial object, e.g., we speak of the extension
` of ether as we speak of the extension of a blanket.

146. There is, we reply, no opposition because there
is distinction between what is really eternal and what is
partially eternal.—16.

That which is really eternal belongs to the three times. But the non-
existence (destruction! of a jar does not belong to three times as‘it was
impossible before the jar was broken. Hence the non-existence (destruc-
tion) of a jar which has a beginning is not really eternal

The objectors have said that things cognised by our sense aré not
necessarily non-eternal, eg., as we perceive a jar we also perceive its
genus jar-ness which is eternal. In reply we say that not all things
cognised by onr sense are non-cternal, but only those that belong to a
certain genus. A jar, for instance, is non-eternal because we perceive it
as belonging to the genns jar-ness. But jar-ness which is cognised by
our sense 18 not non-eternal becanse it does uot helong to a further genus
named jar-ness-ness. Similarly, sound is non-eternal because it is cog-
nised by onr sense as belonging to the genus called sound-ness. |

The aphorism may also he interpreted as fallows:—Sound 18 non-’.
` eternal because it is inferred to advanee in a series.

We do not say that whatever is cogmised by onr sense is non-eternal ;
our jiitention is to say that things cognised by our sense as advancing in
a series ar@& non-eternal, Sound is cognised in that manner (४.९., sound
advances like a wave) and hence sonnd 18 non-eternal

When we speak of the extension of ether we really mean that the
extension belongs to an artificial thing which has for its substratum the
ether. Hence we do not in reality attribute to eternal things the properties

If sound were eternal it would be perceived before pronunciation,
You cannot say that sound really existed before pronunciation but was
covered by some veil, for we do not notice any such veil.

do not perceive the non-perception thereof.—20
The objectors say :-—If you deny the veil because it 18 not perceived
we deny the non-perception of the veil because it 18 also not perceived
The denial of non-perception is the same us the acknowledgment of
perception, or in other words, the veil is acknowledged to be existent.

veil though we do not perceive it.

श्रनुपलम्भात्मकत्वादनुपलब्धेरहेतुः ॥२।९।२२॥

152. This, we reply, 18 110 reason, because non-per-
ception consists of absence of perception.—22
A veil is a thing fit to be perceived. Our non-perception of it

153. Some say that sound is eternal because it is intangible.
Ether, which is intangible, is eternal. Sound must similarly, according to some, be eternal because it is intangible.

154. This we deny, because action is non-eternal. Action is non-eternal though it is intangible. Hence intangibility does not establish eternality.

155. An atom, on the other hand, is eternal though not intangible. Tangibility is not incompatible with eternality, e.g., atoms are tangible yet eternal.

156. Sound, some say, is eternal because of the traditional teaching. A preceptor could not have imparted knowledge to his pupils by means of sounds if these were perishable (non-eternal). In fact, the traditional teaching would, according to the objectors, be impossible if the sounds were non-eternal.

157. This is, we reply, no reason because sound is not perceived in the interval. Suppose a preceptor delivers certain sounds (in the form of lecture) which are received by his pupil. The sounds are not audible in the interval between the preceptor giving them and the pupil receiving them. They would never be inaudible if they were eternal.

158. This, say the objectors, is no argument because there is the teaching. The objectors say: If the sounds, as soon as they came out of the preceptor, were destroyed and did not reach the pupil, there could not be

does not perish or in other words it is eternal.

उभयोः पक्तयोरन्यतरस्याध्यापनादघतिषेधः ॥ २।६। ९९॥
159. In whichever of the two senses it is accepted
the teaching does not offer any opposition.—29.

The word “teaching” may be interpreted either as (1) the pupil’s
receiving the sounds given by his preceptor, or as (2) the pupil’s imitat-
ing the sounds of his prezeptor as oue imitates dancing. Neither of these
interpretations would support the eternality of sound. In consonance
with the first interpretation we shall say that the sound coming ont of
the preceptor produces another soun| and so on until the last sound
reaches the pupil. This would make sonud non-eternal.  I[t is obvious
that the second interpretation similarly proves the non-eternality of sound.

अभ्यासात्‌ ॥ २।९।२०॥
160. Sound, continue the objectors, is eternal because
it is capable of repetition.— 30.

That which is capable of repetition is persistent or not perishable,
e.g.,one and the same colour can he repeatedly looked at because it is
persistent. One and thesame sound can siinilarly be repeatedly uttered,
hence it is persistent or not perishable.

161. It 18, € reply, not so because even if sounds
were “other” (different), repetition could take place.—31.
Repetition does not prevent perishableness because repetition is
possible even if the things repeated are “other” or different, eg., he
sacrifices twice, he dances thrice, ete. Here the two sacrifices are different
and yet we use the repetitive word twice, similarly the three dancings
are different and yet we use the repetitive word ‘ thrice,’

162. Some say that there is no such thing as other-
ness because what is called “other” in reference to some
other is not other in reference to itself.—32.

We maintain that repetition is possible even if the things repeated
are “other” or different. Our position is said to be untenable: the term
“other” is described as unmeaning, as nothing is other than itself.

reply, be no sameness because the two exist in reference to
each other.—33.

If there was no otherness there would. be no sameness. This would
lead us to absurdity as it would disprove both persistency and perish-
ableness. Hence we must admit otherness, and if there is “other” there
will be no flaw in onr expression, viz., repetition is possible even if things
were “other” or different.

Whatever is non-eternal is destroyed by some cause. Sound is said

to have no cause of destruction, bence sound 18 held by some to be not
non-eternal, (2.¢., is regarded as eternal)

165. But by the same argument we are afraid that
non-perception of the cause of inaudition would mean
constant audition.—-35.

If non-perception is to establish non-existence we should not

cease to hear because we do not perceive any cause of onr not hearing
But such a conclusion is absurd

166. Your position, we further say, is untenable
because there is no non-perception, on the contrary there is
perception, of the cause of inaudition.—36

Suppose that a sound is produced by an axe striking against a tree,
This sound will perish after producing another sound which will again
perish giving rise to another and 80 on until the last sound is destroyed
by some obstacle. In fact every sound that is produced is destined to
perish.» Hence thereis no non-perception of the cause of inaudition, on
the contrary there is perception of such a cause Consequently sound
is not eternal

we can stop the sound of a gong

168. We call a thing eternal (persistent) if it con-

Sound does not continue to exist and its cause of cessation is also
perceived. Hence sound is not eternal,

प्रस्परीत्वादप्रातिषेधः ॥२।८्‌ । २९॥
169. (081 € substratum of sound is intangible is no
counter-argument.—39.

Sound has not for its substratum any of the tangible substances,
viz., earth, water, fire and air, for itis found to be produced even where
these do no exist. For instance, sound is produced in a vacuum which
is devoid of smell, taste, colour and tonch which are the qualities of.
tangible substances. The reason why the sound produced in a vacuum
does not reach our ears is that there is no air to carry it. Hence the
substratum of sound is an intangible substance, viz., ether.

It isa peculiarity of sound that it cannot co-abide with colour, ete.
A tangible substance (eg., earth) which is the abode of smell may also
be the abode of colour, taste or touch. But the substance, in which
sound abides, cannot be the abode of any other qualities. ‘This distin-
guishes the substratum of sound from the subtrata of other qualities.
This peculiar substratum is called ether.

The fact of having an intangible substratum is no bar to the non-
eternality of sound. Sound, though its substratum is the intangible ether,
is. produced by the contact of two*hard substances. One sound produces
another sound (or a certain vibration) which again causes another sound
(or vibration) and so on uutil the last sound (or vibration) ceases owing
to some obstacle, Sound is therefore non-eternal.

170. Sound cannot be supposed to co-abide with
other qualities, for there are varieties of it.—40.

In each tangible substance there is only one kind of smell, taste,
touch or colour. If we suppose that sound abides with one or more of
these qualities ina tangihle substance, we must admit that sound is of
one kind only. But sound is of various kinds such as grave, acute, ete. ;
and even the same sound may vary in degrees according to the nature of the
obstruction it meets. 1118 proves that sound does not abide with other
qualities in a tangible substance. It further proves that sound is not

unalterable or eternal.

171. From the injunction about modification and
substitute there arises doubt.-—41.

The word * dadhi’ conjomed with the word ‘atra’ becomes ‘ dadh-
yatra’ by the rule of Sanskrit grammar. Looking at ‘dadhi-atra’ and
‘dadhyatra’ we notice that there is द in the former and y in the latter.
Here some say that द undergoes modification as y while others say that y
comes as substitute for 7 Consequently we are thrown into doubt whether
letters really undergo modifications or take up substitutes.

172. If letters underwent modification an increase of
bulk in the original material would be attended by an in-

crease of bulk in the modification.—42. .

If we accept the theory of modification the letter y which originat-
ed from the short 7 must be supposed to be less in bulk than the y which
originated from the long % But in reality the y in both the cases is of
the same bulk. Hgnce itis concluded that letters do not undergo modi-
fication but take up other letters as substitutes.

cause we find modifications less than, equal to, and greater
than, the original material.—43


========================= START OF PAGE 80 =========================

THE NYAYA-SOTRAS. 55 `

The bulk of the modification does not, in all cases, correspond to
the bulk of the original material, eg., thread is of less bulk than cotton
which is its original material, a bracelet is equal in bulk to the gold of
which it is made, and a banyan tree is greater in bulk than the seed from
which it springs. Hence the argument against the theory of modification
is, according to the objectors, baseless.

नातुल्यप्रकृतीनां विकारविकल्पात्‌ ॥ २। २। ४४ ॥

174. It is, I reply, not so because I spoke of those

modifications which originated from different materials. —44.

A modification may not correspond in bulk to its original material.

But if the original materials are different their modifications are ex-

pected to be different. Here ४ being different from 7? their modifications

are expected to be different. But y issnes from ४ as well as7. Hence
y is not a modification of ¢ or 7.

According to the objector there is difference between the letter 4

cotton and its modification thread.

A modification must be of the same nature with 1/8. original
material, though the former may not correspond in bulk to the latter.
A bracelet is no.doubt a modification of gold or silver but a horse is not a
modification of a bull. Similarly y which is a semi-vowel is not a modi-
fication of ४ (or ४) which is a full vowel.  :

A golden bracelet is converted into a mass of gross gold which

A mass of gold when made into ornaments does not relinquish its

the analogy is unsuitable.

(such as cowliood) are cognisable by the sense, so some eternal things as

The letters cannot be modified if you say that they are eternal
because modification is the reverse of eternalness. When a thing is modi-
fied it assumes another nature, abandoning its own. Again, the letters cannot
be modified if you say that they are impermanent because there is no time
for’ i (of dadhi) to be modified into y when @ (of atra) follows. The sound
‘dadhi’ is produced (pronounced) at the first moment, exists (continuesly)

(atra) is produced (pronounced) at the second moment, exists (continues) during the third moment and perishes at the fourth moment. Now, क (of dadhi) cannot be modified into य until अ (of atra) has come into existence. But क comes into existence at the third moment when अ has already perished. So, on the supposition of impermanency of letters, modification is impossible.

श्रकृत्यनियमाद्रणंविकाराणाम्‌ ॥ २।२। ५६ ॥

186. Letters are not modified because there is no fixity as to the original material of their modification.—56.

In the case of real modifications, there is a fixity as regards their original materials, e.g., milk is the original material of curd, but not vice versa. In the case of letters, however, there is no fixed rule, e.g., क is the original material of य in dadhyatra (dadhi+atra), but य is the original material of इ in vidhyati (vyadh+ya+ti). Hence, the operation of modification is not really applicable to letters.

छ्रनियमे नियमान्नानियमः ॥ २।२। ५७॥

187. Some say that there is no lack of fixity because the absence of fixity itself is fixed.—57.

क is sometimes modified into य and य sometimes into इ. So, in respect of letters, there is no fixity as to the original materials of their modification. This much, however, is fixed: that there is no fixity, or, in other words, the absence of fixity is fixed. Hence, the objector, who is a quibbler, contends that there is fixity at least as to the negative aspect of modification.

नियमानियमविरोधादनियमे नियमाच्चाप्रतिषेधः ॥ २।२। ५८ ॥

188. By saying that the absence of fixity is fixed, you cannot set aside our reason, because fixity and its absence are contradictory terms.—58.

Our reason is that in respect of letters there is no fixity as to their modification. You contend that though there is no fixity, the absence of fixity is fixed. Our reply is that though the absence of fixity is fixed, it does not establish fixity as a positive fact, because fixity is incompatible with the absence of fixity.

If the word dues not denote an individual how is it that we refer to
an individual cow by the expression “ that cow is feeding”? The answer
is that though the word cow may not literally mean an individual we may
refer to the same figuratively. ‘There are such instances as :—‘ Feed the
staff’ means ‘feed the Bralimana holding a staff,’ ‘the scaffolds shout’

In the previous aphorism it was shown that the commission of
sins .would be impossible if we supposed the body to be the soul. _In the
present aphorisin it is argued by an objector that we should be incapable ©
of committing sins even on the supposition of tho soul being distinct —
from our body, for such a soul is eternal and cannot be killed.

6. In reply we say that it is not so because we are
capable of killing the body which is the site of operations
of the soul |

Though the soul is indestructible we can kill the body which is
the seat of its sensations. Henco we are not incapable of committing
sins by killing or murder. Moreaver, if we do not admit a permanent
soul beyond our frail hody we shall be confronted by many absurditiés -
such as “loss of merited action” (krita hani) and “gain of nnmerited
action” (akritabhyAgama). A man who has committed a certain sin may
not suffer its consequences in this life aud unloss there is a soul continuing
to his next life he will not suffer them at all. This isa “loss of merited:
action.” Again, we often find a man suffering the consequences of action
which he neveldid in this life. This would be a “ gain of unmerited
action ” unless we believed that lis soul did the action in his previous life

THE NYAYA-SUTRAS 65

A thing perceived previously by'the left eye is recognised now by
‘the right eye. This would have been impossible if tle soul were identical
with the left eye or the right eye on the principle that the seat of recog-
nition must be the same as the seat of perception. Consequently we
must admit that there isa soul which is distinct from the left and right `
eyes and which is the common seat of perception and recognition

8. Some say that the eyes are not two: the conceit of
duality arises from the single organ of vision being divided
by the bone of the nose.

The objectors argue as follows :—

If the eyes were really two, vez., right and left, we would have been
bound to admita soul distinct from. the senses as the common seat of
_ perception and recognition. But there is only one eye which is divided
by the bridge of the nose and whieh porforms the two functions of
perception and recognition. Hence there is, according to the objectors,
no soul beyond the eye.

9. The eyes, we reply, are really two because the
destruction of one does not cause the destruction of the
other

If the organ of vision: was only one, then on the destruction of that
one (i.e, one eye) there would be total blindness

Remembrance is based on perception, that is, one can remember
only that. thing which one has perceived. It often happens that seeing
the colonr of a thing we remember its smell. This would be impossible
if remembrance was a quality of a senso, eg., the eye which has never
smelt the thing. Hence remembrance must be admitted to be a quality

The substance of the objection is this :—

We can apprehend an object by both the eye and the skin. It is
trne that the acts of seeing and touching the object by one agent cannot
be explained unless we suppose the agent to he distinct from both the eye
and the skin (६९, from the senses), let however the agent be identified
with the mind.

17. Since there is a knower endowed with an instrument
of knowledge it is, we reply, a mere verbal trick to apply .
the name ‘‘ mind”’ to that which is really the “ soul.” m

To explain the acts of seeing, touching, etc., you admit an agent.
distinct from the senses which are called its instruments. The sense or
instrament by which the act of thinking is performed is called the
“mind.” The agent sees by the eye, hears by the ear, smells by the nose,
tastes by the tongue, touches by the skin and thinks by the “ mind.”
Hence we must admif the agent (soul) over and above the mind. If you
call the agent as ‘‘ mind,” you will have to invent another name to
designate the instrament. This verbal trick will not, after all, affect our
position. Moreover, the mind cannot he the agent as it is atomic in
nature. Anatomie agent cannot perform the acts of seeing, hearing,
` knowing, feeling, ete.

18. Your conclusion is moreover opposed tg inference.

We admit a mind apart from the sow). If you deny any one of them —
or identify one with the other, an absurd conclusion will follow. Unless
you admit the mind you will not be able to explain the internal percep-
tion. By the eye you can see, by the ear yon can hear, by the nose-you can
smell, by the tongue you can taste and by the skin you can touch, By
what sense do you carry on internal perception, viz., thinking, imagining,

The form of a face is reflected on a mirror because the latter
possesses transparency. Similarly, a thing is reflected on a crystal inas-
much as the latter is transparent. A wall which does not possess trans-
parency can reflect nothing. It,is therefore entirely due to the nature of
the screens that we can or cannot perceive things through them.

is only one. If there is only one object of sense, the sense must also
be one only. —

62. Itis, we reply, not so because the senses possess
a five-fold character corresponding to the characters of know- `
ledge, sites, processes, forms and materials

The senses must be admitted to be five on the following grounds :— -

(a) The characters of knowledge—There are five senses correspond-
ing to the five characters of knowledge, viz., visual, auditory, olfactory,
gustatory and tactual

(४) The sites—The senses are five on account ofthe various sites
they occupy. The visual sense rests on the eyeball, the auditory sense
on the ear-hole, olfactory sense on the nose, the gustatory sense on the |
tongue, while the tactual sense occupies the whole body.

(c) The processes—There are five senses involving five different
processes, ¢.g., the visual sense apprehends a colour by approaching
it through the (ocular) ray while the tactual sense apprehendsan object
which is in association with the body, and so on.

(व; The forms—The senses are of different forms, e.g., the eye
partakes of the nature of a blue ball, and the ear is not different from
ether, etc. :

(9) The materials—The senses are made up of different materials:
the eye is fiery, the ear is ethereal, the nose is earthy, the tongue 18 watery, `
and the skin (touch) is airy.

63. The senses are essentially identical with the
elements in consequence of the possession of their special

qualities

The five senses, viz., the eye, ear, nose, tongue and skin (touch)
are essentially identical with the five elements, viz., fire, ether, earth,
water and air whose special qualities, viz., colour, sound, smell! (odour),
savour (taste) and tangibility are exhibited by them.

` ` The earth possesses four qualities, viz., odour (smell), savour (taste),
‘colour and tangibility. In water there are three qualities, viz., savour,
colour and tangibility ; colour and tangibility are known to be the qualities
of fire while tangibility and sound belong respectively 10 air and ether. - ~

65. .An objector says that itis 1101 80 because an
element is not apparently found to possess more than one
quality

The substance of the objection 18 that the earth does not possess
four qualities but only one quality, viz, odour (smell) which is apprehended -
by the nose. Water does not possess three qualities but possesses only
096 ` quality, viz., savour (taste) which is apprehended by the tongue
Similarly the other elements do, each of them, possess only one quality

66. The objector further says that the qualities be-
long to the elements, one to one, in their respective order
so that there is non-perception of other qualities in them.

The substance of the objection is this :-—

Odour (smell) is the only quality of the earth. Consequently the
other three qualities, viz., savour (taste), colour and tangibility alleged to
belong to the earth, are not found in it. Savour (taste) is the only quality `
of water, hence the other two qualities, viz., colour and tangibility alleged
to belong to water are not found in it. Colour is the only quality of fire,
and hence the other quality, viz., tangibility alleged to belong to fire is
not found in it. Tangibility isof course the quality of air and sound .

of ether.

68. Ofthe elements one is, according. to the objector,

often interpenetrated by others

The objection is explained as follows :—

The earth is often interpenetrated by water, fire and air and is.
consequently found to possess savour (tasie), colour and tangibility besides
odour (smell). Similar is the case with water ete.

न पार्थिवाप्ययोः प्रत्यक्त्वात्‌ ॥३।१।९॥

69. 1६18, we reply, 0६ 80 because there is visual per-

ception of the earthy and the watery

The Naiydyikas meet the foregoing objections by saying that the
earth really possesses four qualities, water three, fire two, air one,
and ether one. Had the earth possessed only odour (smell) and the
water only savour (taste) then it ‘would have been impossible for us
to see the earthy and watery things. We are competent to see only
those things which possess colour, and if the earth and water had.
not possessed colour low could we have seen them? Since we can
see the earthy and the watery it follows that they possess colour. If you
say that the earth and water are visible because they are mixed with
the fiery things whieh possess colour, why then the air and-ether are
also not visible? There 16 70 rule that it is only the earth and ‘water
that can be mixed with fiery things but that the air and ether cannot bé
so mixed. Proceeding in this way we find that the earth etc. do not
each possess only one quality.

A sense (९. g., the nose) which is the fine part of an element (€. ध the

act-force (sanskdra, karma) of the person possessing the sense. A sense
. cannot perceive more than one object because it possesses the predo-
minant quality of an element, ९. g., the nose possesses only odour which 18
the predominant quality of the earth, the tongue the savour of water, the
eye the colour of fire, and so on.

सयुणानामिन्दियभावात्‌ ॥३।१।७२॥
72. 4. 8611868 is really called as such when it is at-

tended by its quality

Some may say why a senso (the noso for instance) cannot perceive
its own quality (odour). The reply is that a seuse consists of an element
endowed with its quality. It is only when a sense is attended by the quality
that it can see an object. Now in perceiving an object the sense is
attended by the quality but in perceiving its own quality it is not so at-
tended. Consequently a sense cannot perccive its own quality.

तनेवं
तेनेव तस्याग्महणात्च ॥३।१।५२॥
73. Moreover an object is never perceived by itself.
An eye can see an external object but it cannot see itself. On the
game principle a sense cannot perceive its own quality,

न शब्दयुणोपलग्धेः ॥३।१।७४॥
74. It 18, 8006 say, not so because the quality of

sound is perceived by the ear.

The objection stands thus :—
It is not true that a sense cannot perceive its own quality. The ear,

, for instance, can perceive sound which is its own quality.

that.of other qualities and their corresponding substrata.

The.nose, tongue, eye and skin can respectively “smell earth, taste `
‘water, see colour and touch air only when they are attended by their. —
‘own’ qualities, viz, odour (smell), savour (taste), colour and tangibility. `
‘But an ear when it hears sound’ isnot attended by any quality. In fact
the ear is identical with the ether and hears sound by itself. By indirect
inference we can prove that sound is the special quality of the ether:
Odour is the predominant quality of the earth, savour of water, colour of
the eye, and tangibility of the skin (tonch): Sound must therefore be the —
quality of the remaining element, viz., the ether. ,

76. Since the intellect resembles both action and
ether there is doubt as to whether itis transitory or perma-

nent.—-1

Inasmuch as the intellect bears likeness to both action and ether |
in respect of intangibility, there arises the question whether it 18 transi-
tory like an action or permanent like the ether. We find in the intellect .
the function of origination and decay which marks transitory things as |
well as the function of recognition which marks permanent things. “TI
knew the tree,” “I know it” and “I shall know it”~-these are expres-
siéus which involving the ideas of origination and decay indicate our
। knowledge to be transitory. “I who knew the treo yesterday am knowing -
it-again to-day ’—this is an expression which involving the idea of
continuity indicates our knowledgo to be permanent. Hence there is
doubt as to whether the intellect which exhibits both kinds of knowledge
is really transitory or permanent. ।

विषयप्रत्यभिज्ञानात्‌ ॥ ३।२।२॥

_ 77. Some say that the intellect is permanent because
there is recognition of objects.—2.

The Samkhyas maintain the permanency of the intellect on the ground —
of its capacity for the recognition of objects. A thing which was known
before is known again now—this sort of knowledge is called recognition. `
It is possible only if knowledge which existed in the past continues also
at the present, that is, if knowledge is persistent or permanent. Recogni-
tion would have beon impossible if knowledge had been transitory. Hence —
the Simkhyas conclude that the intellect which recognises objects is
` permanent.

साध्यस्तमत्वादहेतुः ॥ ३।२।३ ॥

78. The foregoing reason is not, we say, valid inas-
much as it requires proof like the very subject in dispute.—3..
. ~ Whéther the intellect is permanent or not—this is the subject
in dispute. The Sdmkhyas affirm that it is permanent and the reason:
adduced by them is that it can recognise objects. ‘The Naiydyikas dispute
‘not “only the conclusion of the Samkhyas but 818९ their reason They |


========================= START OF PAGE 109 =========================

say that the intellect does not recognise objects but it is the soul that does:
80. . Knowledge cannot be attributed to an unconscious instrument, the
intellect, but it must be admitted to be a quality of a conscious agent

the soul. If knowledge is not a quality of the soul, what else can be its
quality ? How is the soul to be defined? Thore is therefore no proof as
to the validity of the reason, viz., that the intellect recognises objects.

न युगपदय्हणात्‌ ॥ ३।२।४॥

19. Knowledge is neither a mode of the permanent.
' intellect nor identical with it because various sorts of know-
ledge do not occur simultaneously.—4.

The Samkhyas affirm that knowledge isa mode of the permanent:
intellect from which it is not different. Knowledge, according to them,
is nothing but the permanent intellect modified in the shape of an object
which is reflected on it through the senses. The Naiydyikas’ oppose this
view by saying that if knowledge as a modo of the permanent intelléct is
not different from it, then we must admit various sorts of knowledge to be
permanent. But asa fact various sorts of knowledge are not permanent,
that is, we cannot receive various sorts of knowledge simultancously.’
Hence knowledge is not identical with the permanent intellect.

च्रप्रत्यभिज्ञाने च ` Raa: ॥ ३।२।५॥

80. And in the cessation of recognition there arises
the contingency of cessation of the intellect.—5.

If knowledge as a mode of the intellect is not different from it, then:
the cessation of recognition which is a kind of knowledge should be’
followed by the cessation of tho intellect. This will upset the conclusion
of the Simkhyas that the intellect is permanent. Hence knowledge 18 not
identical with the intellect

The Naiydyikas say that if knowledge as a mode of the permanent
intellect had been identical with it, then there would have been neither a:
variety of knowledge nor origination and cessation of it. The different |
‘gorta of knowledge do-nat occur simultaneously because they are produced, °

82. The recognition (or knowledge) of an object

cannot take place when the mind is drawn away by another
object. —7

` `` € cannot hear a sound by our ear when the mind conjoined with
the eye is drawn away by a colour.. This shows that knowledge is
different from the intellect, and that the mind which is atomic in dimen-
sion serves as an instrument for the production of knowledge.

83. The intellect cannot be conjoined with the senses
in succession because there is no motion in it.—8.

The mind which, according to the Naiyayikas, is atomic in dimension
can move from one sense-organ to another in succession to produce
different kinds of knowledge. This is impossible in the case of the
intellect which, according to the Sémkhyas, is not only permanent but
also all-pervading and as such cannot change its place, that is, does not
possess the tendency to be conjoined with the different sense-organs in
succession. In fact there is only one internal sense called the mind, the
other two so-called internal senses—intellect (Buddhi) and _ sgelf-conceit
(Ahamk4ra)—being superfluous. It is not all-pervading, and knowledge
is not its mode. Knowledge classified as visual, olfactory ete. is of
different kinds which belong to the soul

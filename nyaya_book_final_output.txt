1. Supreme felicity is attained by the knowledge of the true nature of sixteen categories, viz., means of right knowledge (*प्रमाण, pramana*), object of right knowledge (*प्रमेय, pra-meya*), doubt (*संशय, samsaya*), purpose (*प्रयोजन, prayojana*), familiar instance (*दृष्टान्त, dṛṣṭānta*), established tenet (*सिद्धान्त, siddhanta*), members (*अवयव, avayava*), confutation (*तर्क, tarka*), ascertainment (*निर्णय, nirnaya*), discussion (*वाद, vada*), wrangling (*जल्प, jalpa*), cavil (*वितण्डा, vitanda*), fallacy (*हेत्वाभास, hetvābhāsa*), quibble (*छल, chala*), futility (*जाति, jāti*), and occasion for rebuke (*निग्रहस्थान, nigrahasthana*).

Knowledge of the true nature of these sixteen categories means true knowledge of their “enunciation,” “definition,” and “critical examination.” Book I (*of the nyaya-sutra*) treats of “enunciation” and “definition,” while the remaining four Books are reserved for “critical examination.” The attainment of supreme felicity is preceded by the knowledge of four things, viz., (*1*) that which is fit to be abandoned (*viz.,

the english equivalent for “तर्क, tarka” is variously given as “confutation,” “argumentation,” “reductio ad absurdum,” “hypothetical reasoning,” etc.
(vātsyāyana observes:—
जिज्ञासा चास्य शाखस्य प्रवृत्तिः । सर्वं परीक्ष्यते चेति ।
~(nyāyadarpana, p. 9, bibliotheca indica series*).

2. BOOK I, CHAPTER I.

(*1*) Pain, (*2*) that which produces what is fit to be abandoned (*viz., misapprehension, etc.*), (*3*) complete destruction of what is fit to be abandoned, and (*4*) the means of destroying what is fit to be abandoned (*viz., true knowledge*).

गतागतं तावत् तदनन्तरापाः-
यादपवर्गः ॥१।१।२॥

2. Pain, birth, activity, faults, and misapprehension—on the successive annihilation of these in the reverse order, there follows release.

Misapprehension, faults, activity, birth, and pain: these, in their uninterrupted course, constitute the “world.” Release, which consists in the soul’s getting rid of the world, is the condition of supreme felicity, marked by perfect tranquillity and not tainted by any defilement. A person, by the true knowledge of the sixteen categories, is able to remove his misapprehensions. When this is done, his faults, viz., affection, aversion, and stupidity, disappear. He is then no longer subject to any activity and is consequently freed from transmigration and pain. This is the way in which his release is effected and supreme felicity secured.

3. Perception, inference, comparison, and word (*verbal testimony*)—these are the means of right knowledge.

[The Cārvākas admit only one means of right knowledge, viz., perception (*प्रत्यक्ष*); the Vaiśeṣikas and Bauddhas admit two, viz., perception and inference (*अनुमान*); the Sāṅkhyas admit three, viz., perception, inference, and verbal testimony (*शब्द or śabda*); while the Naiyāyikas, whose fundamental work is the Nyāya-sūtra, admit four, viz., perception, inference, verbal testimony, and comparison (*उपमान*). The Prabhākaras admit a fifth means of right knowledge called presumption (*अर्थपत्ति*); the Bhāṭṭas and Vedāntins admit a sixth, viz., non-existence (*अभाव*); and the Pūrva-mīmāṃsākas recognize a seventh and eighth means of right knowledge, named probability (*सम्भाव*) and rumour (*ऐतिह्य*).]

4. Perception is that knowledge which arises from the contact of a sense with its object and which is determinate, unnamable, and non-erratic.

Determinate.—This epithet distinguishes perception from indeterminate knowledge; for instance, a man looking from a distance cannot ascertain whether there is smoke or dust.

Unnamable.—Signifies that the knowledge of a thing derived through perception has no connection with the name which the thing bears.

Non-erratic.—In summer, the sun’s rays coming in contact with earthly heat quiver and appear to the eyes of men as water. The knowledge of water derived in this way is not perception. To eliminate such cases, the epithet non-erratic has been used.

[This aphorism may also be translated as follows: Perception is knowledge which arises from the contact of a sense with its object and which is non-erratic, being either indeterminate (*nirvikalpaka as “this is something”*) or determinate (*savikalpaka as “this is a brahmana”*).]

5. Inference is knowledge which is preceded by perception, and is of three kinds: *a priori*, *a posteriori*, and ‘commonly seen.’

*A priori* is the knowledge of an effect derived from the perception of its cause, e.g., one seeing clouds infers that there will be rain.

*A posteriori* is the knowledge of a cause derived from the perception of its effect, e.g., one seeing a river swollen infers that there was rain.

‘Commonly seen’ is the knowledge of one thing derived from the perception of another thing with which it is commonly seen, e.g., one seeing a beast possessing horns infers that it also possesses a tail, or one seeing smoke on a hill infers that there is fire on it.

Vatsyayana takes the last to be “not commonly seen,” which he interprets as the knowledge of a thing which is not commonly seen, e.g., observing affection, aversion, and other qualities, one infers that there is a substance called soul.

6. Comparison is the knowledge of a thing through its similarity to another thing previously well known.

4. 200 I, CHAPTER I.

A man, hearing from a forester that a *bos gavaeus* is like a cow, resorts to a forest where he sees an animal like a cow. Having recollected what he heard, he institutes a comparison, by which he arrives at the conviction that the animal which he sees is a *bos gavaeus*. This is knowledge derived through comparison. Some hold that comparison is not a separate means of knowledge, for when one notices the likeness of a cow in a strange animal, one really performs an act of perception. In reply, it is urged that we cannot deny comparison as a separate means of knowledge, for how else does the name *bos gavaeus* signify the general notion of the animal called *bos gavaeus*? That the name *bos gavaeus* signifies one and all members of the *bos gavaeus* class is not a result of perception but the consequence of a distinct knowledge called comparison.

7. Word (*verbal testimony*) is the instructive assertion of a reliable person.

A reliable person is one—be he a *yogi*, *Arya*, or *mleccha*—who, as an expert in a certain matter, is willing to communicate his experience of it.

[Suppose a young man coming to the side of a river cannot ascertain whether the river is fordable or not, and immediately an old, experienced man of the locality, who has no enmity against him, comes and tells him that the river is easily fordable: the old man's word is to be accepted as a means of right knowledge called verbal testimony.]

8. It is of two kinds, viz., that which refers to matter which is seen and that which refers to matter which is not seen.

The first kind involves matter which can be actually verified. Though we are incapable of verifying the matter involved in the second kind, we can somehow ascertain it by means of inference.

[Matter which is seen, e.g., a physician’s assertion that physical strength is gained by taking butter.]

[Matter which is not seen, e.g., a religious teacher's assertion that one conquers heaven by performing horse-sacrifices.]

9. Soul, body, senses, objects of sense, intellect, mind, activity, fault, transmigration, fruit, pain, and release—are the objects of right knowledge.  The objects of right knowledge are also enumerated as substance, quality, action, generality, particularity, intimate relation [and non-existence, which are the technicalities of the Vaiśeṣika philosophy].

10. Desire, aversion, volition, pleasure, pain, and intelligence are the marks of the soul. [These abide in the soul, or rather are the qualities of the substance called soul].

11. Body is the site of gesture, senses, and sentiments. Body is the site of gesture inasmuch as it strives to reach what is desirable and to avoid what is hateful. It is also the site of senses, for the latter act well or ill according as the former is in good or bad order. Sentiments, which comprise pleasure and pain, are also located in the body, which experiences them.

12. Nose, tongue, eye, skin, and ear are the senses produced from elements. Nose is of the same nature as earth, tongue as water, eye as light, skin as air, and ear as ether.

14. Smell, taste, color, touch, and sound are objects of the senses and qualities of the earth, etc. Smell is the object of the nose and the prominent quality of earth; taste is the object of the tongue and quality of water; color is the object of the eye and quality of light; touch is the object of the skin and quality of air; and sound is the object of the ear and quality of ether.
